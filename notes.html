<ul>
<li><a href="#/slide-orgcdf1d1a">20.1.1. e.g. (Source: Russ Olsen) Russ helped me see that Namespaces were simply mappings of names to values but my learning of the subject was distracted by my instinct to tackle the complex aspects of Namespaces: symbols refer to vars, which refer to mutable storage locations, which contain values. These are too many incidental details to take on for a newcomer and distract from the fundamental simplicity of what Namespaces are about. It does, however, help to know that such incidental complexity has a purpose in Clojure, which is to keep unaware developers from shooting their toes off. This mentor related perspective helped me accept Clojure's complexity around Namespaces with more of an open mind, taking the sting out of it.</a></li>

<ul>
<li><a href="#/slide-orgde5ac16">23.1. How can we best support the needs of Clojure learners? Imagine a future where a person interested in learning Clojure was presented with a menu of learning paths, each leading to well defined learning outcomes and offering various 'on-ramps' for learners of varying skill levels, especially, for learners completely new to programming. Imagine a future where every learner feels welcome and supported through supportive human relationships, from participation in users groups, educational co-ops, and especially one-on-one apprentice/mentor pairings. How can we place the needs of the learner above all else and grow Clojure to the scale of its full potential? Much progress has already been made, but what more can we do, together, to reach this goal?</a></li>

A community-centered brainstorming session facilitated by vulnerably sharing my unconventional ideas about learning to program, and graciously inviting others to share their own. An experiment in group problem solving applied to the problem of learning 'Clojure'.</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="#/slide-orgc2bf227">23.2.1. 'Clojure' as used here is a heavily overloaded term, referring the body of knowledge encompassing Clojure(ish) technologies: ClojureScript, Datomic, React, React Native, bash/zshell, deployment technologies such as immutable infrastructure etc. etc. etc.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#/slide-orged3672d">23.3. I intend to foster an interactive conversation with my audience about how we can create stronger and more creative mentor/apprentice relationships in our growing community. The jumping off point would be my personal learning path of going from Hero to Zero. (Hero to Zero is a greatly overloaded term that is meaningful to me, but likely mysterious to others, so it will be a conversational thread wherein I can relay my personal experience of learning programming and Clojure.)</a></li>

<ul>
<li>To encourage the continuous improvement of our collective ability to learn.</li>
<li>To attract new programmers, open source authors and software entrepreneurs to the Clojure community.</li>

</ul>

<p>
And besides all that, it's a great excuse to talk about two of my favorite things: Clojure &amp; Learning!

<p>
My hope is that you will walk away from this talk with a fresh awareness of the value of learning in your own life, in the Clojure community and in the world at large. You will be offered a specific new habit to employ in your weekly routine to elevate learning to its deserved rank, <i>exponentiating</i> your productivity, not only in your studies, but in every project you touch.

<h4 id="orgcdf1d1a"><span class="section-number-4">20.1.1</span> e.g. (Source: Russ Olsen) Russ helped me see that Namespaces were simply mappings of names to values but my learning of the subject was distracted by my instinct to tackle the complex aspects of Namespaces: symbols refer to vars, which refer to mutable storage locations, which contain values. These are too many incidental details to take on for a newcomer and distract from the fundamental simplicity of what Namespaces are about. It does, however, help to know that such incidental complexity has a purpose in Clojure, which is to keep unaware developers from shooting their toes off. This mentor related perspective helped me accept Clojure's complexity around Namespaces with more of an open mind, taking the sting out of it.</h4>

<h3 id="orgde5ac16"><span class="section-number-3">23.1</span> How can we best support the needs of Clojure learners? Imagine a future where a person interested in learning Clojure was presented with a menu of learning paths, each leading to well defined learning outcomes and offering various 'on-ramps' for learners of varying skill levels, especially, for learners completely new to programming. Imagine a future where every learner feels welcome and supported through supportive human relationships, from participation in users groups, educational co-ops, and especially one-on-one apprentice/mentor pairings. How can we place the needs of the learner above all else and grow Clojure to the scale of its full potential?
