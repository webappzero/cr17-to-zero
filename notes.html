aha! about the `PROPERTIES` below setting <span class="underline">all</span> slide backgrounds vs. just this one:
if the extra space in the *_ title/header1 is removed (which annoyingly happens automatically (autoformat?)
then the value is extended to ALL slides, but if the second space remains and the '  ' is treated as the header title,
then the custom background applies only to the slide.

Thank you Ryan for hosting another great Clojure Remote conference, and for inviting me to speak. And a big thank you to everyone whose with us today. Welcome to my talk, <i>The Value of Learning</i>.

<p>
TODO (Insert drawing pictures here as a "hook'em")
</p>

<p>
My name is Jay, and this past year I've had two main learning pursuits: The Clojure programming language and the subject of learning itself.
</p>

<p>
This talk was written with two particular audiences in mind: Programmers &amp; Aspiring Programmers, but anyone with an interest in learning should find the talk personally relevant.
</p>

<p>
I'm not an expert in programming or in the science of learning. This talk is a slice of my life experiences of learning and learning to program. My hope is that you will find something herein to help you in your own learning journey, whatever your goals may be. So,here we go! 
</p>

<p>
"The Value of Learning."
</p>

<p>
Just how much do I value learning? 
</p>

<p>
How can I determine how much value I place on something like learning?
</p>

<p>
If I discover that I value learning greatly, how can I live a life consistent with this core value?

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Before I jump in and try to answer the central question of this talk, I feel the need to justify the basic nature of the question, because <i>learning</i> appears to be among the most universally accepted of human values. At first glance the answer to the question, "Do I value learning?" appears to be so obvious that the question seems silly or trite, maybe even a complete waste of time.
</p>

<p>
Bertrand Russell said, "In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted."
</p>

<p>
I believe that we have a lot to gain and nothing to lose by putting Bertrand Russell's wisdom to work on the subject of learning.
</p>

<p>
Invisible values risk being neglected values. My hope is that by thoughtfully assessing the value of learning for ourselves, we can mitigate this risk and reach our individual and collective learning potential.
</p>

<p>
At the very least, attempting to answer this question is in accord with the age old wisdom, "know thyself."  (time 3:32)

<h3 id="orgb3ff571">Brain, the invisible organ</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
While learning may be the invisible value, the brain is the invisible organ. At least that's the excuse I use to explain why, in my youth, I was <b>not</b> very interested in the brain, or how I could use it to improve my life.
</p>

<p>
I mean, for all its potential power, surely there must be some explanation why the brain wasn't appreciated more deeply in my youth.
</p>

<p>
A couple of reasons have come to mind:
</p>

<p>
In my case, the brain science of the day led my teachers to inform me that I was given a fixed number of brain cells, and no new cells would ever be produced. What I heard was "You can't any smarter. You've either got it or you don't."
</p>

<p>
And here's another simple observation &#x2013; the brain <i>cannot</i> compete with a heartbeat. As a very young child, getting to know my own body, the heartbeat was a constant reminder, "I have a heart!"
</p>

<p>
Maybe the brain just needs better PR. This talk hopes to remedy that. No let's proceed with body of the talk by starting with the question.  (time 4:38)

<p>
<i>Value</i> as used in our central question means <b>relative worth, utility, or importance</b>.
</p>

<p>
The history of the word value goes back through Middle English to the Anglo-French work <i>valu</i>, which means <b>worth</b> or <b>high quality</b>, and finally, all the way back to the Latin, <i>valēre</i>, which means <b>to be well</b> or <b>have strength</b>.
</p>

<p>
If you're a Game of Thrones fan, you've likely noticed how similar <i>valēre</i> sounds to Valyria, home to the forges of Valyrian steel, renowned for its quality and strength.

<p>
<i>Learning</i> means <b>the activity or process of gaining knowledge or skill by studying, practicing, being taught, or experiencing something</b>.
</p>

<p>
The history of the word <i>learn</i> goes back through the Middle English word <i>lernen</i>, which shares the meaning <b>to learn</b> with the Old English word <i>leornian</i>, and further back to the Old English word <i>last</i> which means <b>foot print</b>, and finally, all the way back to the latin word <i>lira</i> which means <b>furrow</b> or <b>track</b>.
</p>

<p>
The meaning <b>track</b> ties in neatly with the <b>foot print</b> from the Old English <i>last</i>. 
</p>

<p>
But the word furrow really stuck out to me. Firstly because I didn't know what it meant in this context, which is <b>a long trench</b>. But not just any trench! <b>a long narrow trench in the ground made by a plow, especially for planting seeds</b>.
</p>

<p>
The latin meaning has become my favorite way to think about learning &#x2013; planting a trail of seeds, seeds of knowledge and skill, which will grow and flourish in time! How cool is that!?!

<aside class="notes">
<p>
As far back as the 13th century, the word <i>learn</i> was also used to mean "teach". As in "Master blacksmiths learned their apprentices in the craft of sword forging." 
</p>

<p>
Today this alternative meaning is relegated to speech, because it's <b>not</b> considered ideal grammar.

This question could have been tackled any number of ways. I stumbled upon this one by following my nose and trying not to fall behind my deadline. Oh time! I would enjoy revisiting the question anew, perhaps from a purely mathematical perspective.

These are too many incidental details to take on for a newcomer and distract from the fundamental simplicity of what Namespaces are about. It does, however, help to know that such incidental complexity has a purpose in Clojure, which is to keep unaware developers from shooting their toes off. This mentor related perspective helped me accept Clojure's complexity around Namespaces with more of an open mind, taking the sting out of it.</h4>

Imagine a future where every learner feels welcome and supported through supportive human relationships, from participation in users groups, educational co-ops, and especially one-on-one apprentice/mentor pairings.

Learning is like breathing &#x2013; we're always doing it.

All joking aside, I'm deeply interested in this topic because learning to program, for me, has been a joy, but also a painful and lonely struggle. My experience and instincts tell that by the time most people discover Clojure, they've suffered needlessly for too long. I hope this talk can reach out and find aspiring learners at the outset of their learning journey. What can we do together to make learning Clojure a fantastic experience for everyone?
