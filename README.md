# Optimal Remote Learning, learning how to learn, teach and grow Clojure

This project is place where we, the Clojure Community, can document our conversation and code relating to a 'conversation' I have proposed for [Clojure Remote 2017](https://clojureremote.com/).

The core topic is Remote Learning.

If you're interested in learning more, please see the file [notes.org](https://github.com/webappzero/cr17-to-zero/blob/master/notes.org) in the root of this project. I'll be blogging about this topic frequently at [webappzero.com](http://webappzero.com).

My best,  
Jay  
@webappzero

## Usage

Please submit any ideas, topics, questions or comments you may have by creating a topic folder within the [ideas](https://github.com/webappzero/cr17-to-zero/tree/master/ideas) folder in the root of this project, wherein you and I can discuss your ideas. I'll keep an eye out for your Pull Request.

If you prefer, we can discuss you idea face to face in an online meeting or over the phone, just [schedule a meeting with me](https://calendly.com/jaymartin) and I'll reply with a link to our meeting.

Presently, this project only contains notes, not working software, but that might change soon.
