* Welcome

 #+BEGIN_NOTES 
 Thank you Ryan. I'm happy to be here at Clojure Remote 2017 and honored to speak to this group of enthusiastic Clojure folks.  Welcome to each of you that are with us today to hear about /The Value of Learning/.

 Lately, I've become enthralled by the subject of learning. Here's one example of why:

 5 days. These people, people not unlike you or me, learned the technical fundamentals of drawing in only 5 days. 
 
 Personally, I'm astonished by these drawings.
 
 The rapid progress of these students reminds of the scene in The Matrix, where Neo and Trinity see a helicopter. He asks her "Can you fly that thing?" and she replies, "Not yet". Moments later

 (NEXT FRAG) she is skillfully flying the aircraft.
 
 How does their teacher

 (NEXT FRAG), Betty Edwards, facilitate such efficient progress for *all* of her students, not just some?
 
 And how is her approach relevant to learning other highly technical skills, such as programming?
 
 We'll explore these, and other engaging questions, over the next hour, but first let's frame up the conversation.

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   What are my qualifications for giving this talk?

   I'm speaking to you today as a layperson.

   And if I've learned anything about this subject, its that learning is full of paradox.

   It often results from a process of reconciliation between competing ideas or ways of thinking.

   Almost any statement of truth I might profess about learning, can probably be argued the other way as well.
 
   This wasn't readily apparent to me when I began this project, but its crystal clear to me now.

   And I'm more humble for the effort.

   Fortunately, I have a long and

   (NEXT FRAG) documented history of putting my foot in my mouth.

   This talk aims to kick start an ongoing conversation about our individual and shared experiences of learning.

   One of my favorite things about learning today is that when you start researching a topic, such as learning, all of sudden you start attracting related information to yourself, whether it's your YouTube feed suggesting videos or a friend telling you about a helpful idea.

   I've experienced so many wonderful moments like that while researching this talk, thanks to so many generous people who've shared with me their own learning experiences with insight and candor.

   My hope is that by candidly sharing my own learning experiences publicly, other people might identify with my learning triumphs and struggles, and that together we might be able find a better way of tackling some of our common problems around learning and teaching.

   This interactive talk is designed to be an ongoing conversation.

   It began its life as an open source github repository, and has evolved into an open-data project, driven by your anonymous, interactive input.

   Scattered throughout the talk, you'll notice a red pill

   (NEXT FRAG) appear on the lower right corner of the screen.

   Each pill contains a QR code.

   These red-pills lead to mini-polls, links to kick-start your research, or pre-filled tweets that will serve to network like minds around the subject of learning.

   Even if you're watching this on video, months or years from now, you can still participate by scanning the red pills with your smart phone.

   If you don't have a smart phone handy, or if you're watching this on your smart phone, you can relax and enjoy the show because we'll be converting the presentation into an interactive web site soon.

   This is it. This is your red pill, blue pill moment!

   Scan the red pill now if, like me, you were astonished by the drawings done by Betty Edward's students and are curious to learn more.

   We're going to explore many aspects of learning through the framework of learning's /*worth*/.

   Let's get started!

** Learning, the invisible value
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted. -- Bertrand Russell
  #+END_QUOTE

  #+BEGIN_NOTES

 Before we assess the central question of this talk, let me /try/ to clarify the question.

 /Education/ is often touted as a panacea to to the world's problems.

 Over time, I've observed that different people mean different things when saying these exact same words.

 Learning is obviously important, but when we talk about learning, what do we mean?

 School? College? Career? Breathing?

 Okay, fortunately some things come to us quite naturally.

 At first glance, the question "What is the value of learning?" appears to be quite basic. 

 It was Bertrand Russell who said, "In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted."

 I believe that we have a lot to gain, and nothing to lose, by applying Russell's wisdom to the subject of learning.

 Invisible values risk becoming neglected values.

 If we persist in repeating the mantra "education is the answer", without periodically reflecting on it's meaning, the words begin to ring hollow and lose their power.

 My hope is that by thoughtfully assessing the value of learning for ourselves, we can discover something new, something overlooked, and gain insight into the invisible value of learning.

  #+END_NOTES

** Brain, the invisible organ
 #+BEGIN_NOTES 

 While learning may be the invisible value, the brain is the invisible organ. At least that's my explanation of why, in my youth, I was *not* very interested in the brain, or how I could use it to improve my life.

 For all its potential power, surely there /must be/ some explanation why I wasn't in awe of the brain.

 A couple of reasons have come to mind:

 In my case, the brain science of the day said that once a human embryo was fully developed the brain had a fixed number of brain cells, and no new cells would ever be produced.

 The message behind the message, to my ear, was "You can't get any smarter. You're either smart or you're not."

 And maybe there's another reason why the brain goes unappreciated to kids -- the brain has to compete with a heartbeat. As a very young child, the heartbeat was a constant reminder, "I have a heart!"

 It's funny how as I child, I never really thought about my brain thinking. It was always "me thinking".

 Truth is, even to this day its kind of weird for me to think about the brain thinking.

 Is thinking for me, as me? I give up.

 Maybe the brain just needs better PR. This talk hopes to remedy that.

#+END_SRC

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="citation">merriam-webster.com</div>

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
The history of the word value goes back through Middle English to the Anglo-French word /valu/, which means *worth* or *high quality*, and finally, all the way back to the Latin, /valēre/, which means *to be well* or *have strength*.

If you're a Game of Thrones fan, you've likely noticed how similar /valēre/ sounds to Valyria, home to the forges of Valyrian steel, which is renowned for its quality and strength.

*the activity or process of gaining knowledge or skill by studying, practicing, being taught, or experiencing something*

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="citation">learnersdictionary.com</div>

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
/Learning/ means *the activity or process of gaining knowledge or skill by studying, practicing, being taught, or experiencing something*.

According to the definition, gaining knowledge or skill is the goal of learning.

Knowledge or skill. I like the simplicity of that.

And, there are a handful of ways to gain knowledge or skill: study, practice, observation, and experience.

Latin

#+END_SRC

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="citation">merriam-webster.com</div>

#+BEGIN_NOTES 

The history of the word /learn/ goes back through the Middle English word /lernen/, which shares the meaning *to learn* with the Old English word /leornian/, and further back to the Old English word /last/ which means *foot print*, and finally, all the way back to the latin word /lira/ which means *furrow* or *track*.

The word furrow really sticks out to me. A furrow is *a long trench*. But not just any trench! *a long narrow trench in the ground made by a plow, especially for planting seeds*. 

The latin meaning is my new, favorite way to think about learning -- planting a trail of seeds, seeds of knowledge and skill, which will grow and flourish in time! How cool is that!?!

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
After the time of Socrates, humankind's progress in adult education experiences a small gap.

(NEXT FRAG canyon)

The 1926 paper /The Meaning of Adult Education/, by Eduard C. Lindeman, reignited the subject of learning and established a scientific, research oriented approach to understanding how adults learn.  

It's helpful to remember that the science of learning is a young science.

** Two faces of education
- Outside In
- Inside Out

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
The meaning of the word education is surrounded by scholarly debate, stemming from the two branches of its latin roots.

These two faces of education can be generally described as /Outside In/ vs /Inside Out/. 

(NEXT SLIDE DOWN)

.

.

.

.
#+END_NOTES


*** Outside In
educare: to train or mold

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
The latin /educare/ means: to train or mold.

Proponents of the "outside in" perspective of education seek to impart knowledge and form students by shaping them according to templates of idealized virtues and skill.

As in, "The University educates its students by giving them knowledge."

When I first encountered the Clojure programming language, I'd never heard anyone distinguish between identity, values & time.

I definitely needed some "outside in" education!

(NEXT SLIDE DOWN)

.

.

.

.

.

.

.
#+END_NOTES

*** Inside Out
educere: to lead out
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
The latin /educere/ means: to lead out.

Advocates of the "inside out" perspective of education seek to prepare the student for the unpredictable challenges of the future by focusing the pupil's attention on the process of acquiring new skills and knowledge.

As in, "The students education is evident in their lifelong curiosity about the world in which they live."

I have a personal bias toward inside-out education.

When I hear the word "learn", I typically associate it with the inside-out mode of education.

Because I know I'm biased, I strive to return to the ideological position that both faces of education have their ideal time and place, and that we are in the early stages of discovering an ideal balance between the two.

The science and math scores in the U.S. over the past couple decades show an over-reliance on outside-in education.

Students here in the U.S. are given a new problem, immediately followed by the recipe to solve the problem.

In German, Japan and other high performing countries, students are challenged to think through the problem, after being reminded of recent supportive lessons.

Then students work in teams to try to solve the problem.

Only then, is the answer revealed, after which students compare their own strategies with the, quote "official answer".

Educators call this 'productive struggle'. 

I like to call it 'structured struggle', but whatever you call it, at its heart it's a prime example of "Inside Out" learning.

Even Socrates would be proud!

Whatever learning is, it is nothing without change. And sometimes that change is in the form of adoption and growth within an established system, and sometimes it requires us to move beyond, and into an exploration of the unknown, unworthy, or invisible.

Inside-out, or outside-in? *Yes*.
#+END_NOTES

** Review the question
How +much+ do I value learning?

# Isaac: In light of needing to sculpt some mass away, this might be an area of reconsideration. 
# A discussion of the historico-philosophico-logistics of axiology seems somewhat out of place, given a focus on "learning about learning"... perhaps leading unnecessarily towards "learning about valuation systems".
 
# In light of this (and as background for my reasoning), I might offer that, in fact, learning is unavoidable. It a necessary and functionally fundamental part of being human (or even a mouse). Scientifically speaking, it might be considered that learning can be described as the brain "re-wiring" itself in response to stimulus. And the brain is _always_ rewiring, and we are never without stimulous.[fn:ft-wt] We are _essentially_ plastic (in the material-behavior sense).
# [fn:ft-wt]: "Fire-together, wire-together," is a common neurosciency mantra. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory

# Given this, the challenge of _valuing_ my own learning extends to the reaches of valuing my _self_, which seems out of context from a more tangible and pragmatic perspective on "learning about learning." 
 
# Instead, it may be worth bringing attention to questions like "_How_ are you learning? What does that look like?", "How does that compare to how you worked in school (where 'learning' is the supposed _MO_)?", "When, and what do you teach?" "What challenges do you face as a student or a teacher in the context of Clojure?"
 
# Which might lead nicely into The Actions, and open a door to considering learning in regard to Clojure and it's people.


#+BEGIN_NOTES 
We've discovered some new ways of thinking about education & learning. Now we can ask the question again, this time with a deeper sense of meaning:

How much do I value learning?

Now it's time to look for an answer. And while we're at it, we'll discover how Betty Edwards accelerates the pace of her student's progress.

** Axiology
The philosophical study of value.
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Pursuing this question led me to the field of axiology, which is the philosophical study of value.

This study dates back to the time of ancient Greece, when Plato first wrote about the distinction between intrinsic value and instrumental value.

*** Intrinsic vs Instrumental
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
According to axiology, learning has intrinsic value if it is valuable in and of itself.

Learning has instrumental value if it serves as a means toward achieving something else.

As in, "Learning to speak German helped me make new friends in Berlin."

#+END_NOTES

*** Limitations of Axiology
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Axiology provides a helpful framework for /thinking and talking/ about the value of something, because values are more nebulous than facts.

If values were facts, we could seek an answer to our question scientifically. Is there a way to convert values into facts?

What other fields might help us?

** Value Theory

 # file:resources/images/2000px-MaslowsHierarchyOfNeeds.svg.png # in case of seriousness

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Value theory is a modern approach to understanding value. It stems from axiology, but seeks to determine value through scientific observation.

What do people value and why? Psychology, sociology and economics each provide a unique lens through which to study value.

For example, a sociologist might be interested in how different groups of people value learning similarly or differently.

An economist might choose to measure the value of learning in terms of goods and services related to learning which are sold in the marketplace.

They might also point out 'opportunity cost' as a means of assessing the value of learning.

If I choose to learn to speak German, what return on investment could've been realized with an alternate and equal investment in time and money?

A psychologist might seek to measure the value of learning by categorizing learning subjects according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

Value theory is encouraging us to find a quantifiable way of measuring the value of learning.

** Flip the question

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
At this point in my research, I thought of a potential shortcut to answering the question. What if we could prove that learning was harmful?

We're in the age of information. Knowledge streams across the internet at up to two thirds the speed of light. Isn't it possible that malicious actors could use this information destructively?

I'm learning to program, and I want to help others learn too. Are these actions helping society or are they hurting?

This is an important question! If they're hurting, I should cease and desist now.

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
So, /*is*/ learning harmful?

Upon asking this question, I struck gold in finding the article (NEXT FRAG) /Is knowledge "good" or "neutral"?/

The author, Piotr Wozniak, raises some of the same questions I was asking myself about malicious actors in the world.

Wozniak claims that Knowledge is good.

The article supports this claim by elaborating in great detail over a simple five-step chain of reasoning.

Wozniak argues that humans benefit through cooperation and lose out on conflict, and claims this truth can be demonstrated mathematically with the tools of game theory.

This article was chiefly responsible for justifying my natural instinct to help others learn.

We don't have time to walk through his reasoning in detail, but I highly recommend this article as an exercise in critical thinking.

After reading the article, I noticed that I felt a bit more lighthearted in my work.

I'm convinced it helped relieve my cognitive dissonance about facilitating technological advances for our society.

** Systems of value
- hedonism
- religion
- scientific axiology

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Wozniak's article also serves as a gentle introduction to axiology and value theory.

There are three major systems of value: hedonism, religion and scientific axiology.

Hedonism values pleasure and devalues pain. It's been around since multi-celled organisms developed nervous systems.

Religion uses faith and reason to ascribe value.

And Scientific axiology strives to measure value using only the scientific method. 

All other systems of value can be categorized in or among these three.

Most people apply a conglomeration of these three value systems to evaluate their goals.

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
How can I measure the value I place on learning?

Before I reveal my method, I'd like to offer this disclaimer.

This is my first stab at the problem and the method is far from perfect.

There are simpler methods, but they would require more time, time I didn't have in preparing for this talk.

The simplest method I could think of would be to measure how much time in a given month do I dedicate specifically to learning.

Unfortunately, I don't have a month to spare, so please excuse the complexity of my next best solution. Drum roll please...

The method I've chosen aims to quantify the role of learning in my life.

My general strategy is to look back over my life, identify significant memories, and try to assign a quantifiable value to that memory somehow.

How can I break this big problem up in to smaller pieces?

Inspired by Maslow's hierarchical pyramid of needs, I've divided my life into 10 major categories.

(NEXT FRAG)

These are: Health, Family, Friends, Community, Romance / Art, Career / Business, Fun / Hobbies/ Recreation, Philosophical / Spiritual, Personal Finance, Personal Development & Learning.

These categories serve a dual purpose.

First, they serve as a way for me to look back on my life memories and recall stories that relate to a given category, which I will call the home category.

Second, they serve as a way to quantify value, where each category will be worth 100 points.

In fairness, I want to recall the same number of stories from each category.

Each memory has the potential to impact between 1 and 10 life categories.

If a memory affects multiple categories, the home category of that memory will score 100 points for each affected category, and each affected category will score 100 points for being "tagged" by that memory.

For example, if a memory from the learning category about learning to ride my bike affects 3 categories, Fun, Family and Learning, then the home category of of learning will earn 300 points, and the other two categories Fun and Family will earn 100 points each.

In this way, categories earn points for playing a role in my significant life memories. 

The logic behind this strategy is that a memory which stands out in my mind is a valuable memory, otherwise I would have forgotten about it.

The obvious exceptions are painful memories, like when I broke my arm, which will be filtered out, unless they have some obvious life value.

As you can imagine, this process has the potential to bring up deeply personal memories, and lucky for you we don't have time for my entire life story.

Instead I've curated a short list of memories which are relevant to this talk.

I'll use 2 or 3 of the following stories as examples of how I scored memories according to described method.

Where should we start? How about near the beginning?

** Worldview
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_extra_attr: video-size="full"
:END:
#+BEGIN_NOTES
My first story stems from the family category

At the age of 3, I lived with my Mother in an apartment on the outskirts of Lincoln, Nebraska.

In the evenings we sat on the balcony and watched the sunset over the golden wheat fields and countryside.

One evening the sun set down right behind an old barn on the horizon.

This was an exciting event for me.

I was convinced that the sun was hiding just behind that barn, just over the hill where it had disappeared. 

I remember, more than anything, just how badly I wanted to touch the sun!

My mother, instead of telling me that that's just not the way the world works, drove me out to that barn the very next day at sunset.

I could see for myself that we were at the barn, and still the sun was setting yet a long ways off.

I learned something that day about how sunsets work, but I learned a far more important lesson about the power of demonstration and involving the pupil smack dab in the middle of a lesson, or a barn in the middle of nowhere in this case. Thanks Mom!

** Imagination

#+BEGIN_NOTES

My next story is about imagination.

At the age 6 my best friend was Steve Peterson.

Steve and I met at the apartments where I lived in Columbia, SC.

He had a single Mom and so did I.

The four of us were practically inseparable, and remain lifelong friends to this day.

His mother Barbara Peterson was a kindergarten teacher. She was very good at her job.

So good in fact, that she found herself being interviewed by Mr. Rogers on PBS. Mr Rogers!

Playing at Steve's house was the best.

Mrs. Peterson was masterful at sparking imagination.

She encouraged us to use our imaginations often.

She sewed super hero and other costumes for us to wear.

The memory that came to mind instantly when I challenged myself to recall a life memory from the friends category is the day Steve and I went into a restaurant to order a hamburger.

Steve and I were 5 and 6 years old, dressed up as college football players, each of us donning a uniform of the big local rivalry here in SC, the Carolina Gamecocks and Clemson Tigers.

What makes the moment so memorable is that just before we got out of the car to go inside the local Wendy's, we turned to Mrs. Peterson and pleaded with her not tell anyone we weren't really college football players.

"Oh no, of course I wouldn't give you away!" she said.

It makes me smile to this day to think that we actually thought we'd be mistaken for college athletes.

Mrs. Peterson taught me more than I could summarize in 10 hours, much less one, but that day I learned how to pretend which it turns out is a great skill to have.

** Childlike Wonder & Awe

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
This next story is great example of inside out vs outside in learning, as it spans both.

When I was around 8 years old I had a subscription to a kid's science magazine.

I remember how amazed I was at learning new facts about the world.

Animals were often my favorite subjects.

Like how a blue whale's arteries are so large in diameter that a small child could swim through them. You know, cool stuff!

I loved getting a new magazine at the beginning of the month, and would devour it within days, completely self-motivated to learn, a classic example of inside-out education.

The other thing I loved to do was share these facts with other people, and watch their faces light up with amazement, shock or awe.

Sometimes though, my timing was terrible.

It was Thanksgiving day at Mrs. Peterson's and the table was set with Turkey and fixings.

Everyone was hungry and we were ready to dig in, but first I needed to share an important fact with everyone!

"Did you guys know that black pepper contains the highest percentage of insect parts, according the FDA?"

I'll never forget the look on my Mom's face.

She had some outside-in educating to do! And she did it.

I'll never forget the joy of reading those magazines.

I treasure the child-like sense of awe & wonder that I learned to cultivate by reading through those pages. And, of course, I always watch my manners at the dinner table! :O

Thanks again, Mom!

** Professor McKee 

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
In college, I had one professor that came to mind instantly when thinking about the career category.

Professor Jim McKee.

Professor McKee was a consummate professional.

Being in his class felt more like participating in a job interview than it did a classroom.

His sayings still echo in my head:

"If you're not 5 minutes early, you're 5 minutes late!"

"You never get a second chance to make a first impression!"

And the arm length rule:

"If you're within arms length of someone, stick out your hand and introduce yourself."

Professor McKee told a story of his first big job break.

He had an interview in an office building down town.

He applied the arm length rule and introduced himself to the person riding the elevator with him.

Turns out that person was his interviewer for the job, which of course he got.

But the image of professor McKee I'll never get out of my head is the day he taught us how to draw cash flow diagrams in our engineering economics class.

"The day of your investment you draw the arrow down because you have to part with your money so you're feeling low, low, low," he said as he drooped his torso, arms practically mopping the floor.

"The day of your return on investment, you draw the arrow up, up, up!" he shouted as hopped on top his his desk and jumped up and down to the rhythm of his mantra.

Professor McKee taught me just how much difference one teacher can in a person's life. Thanks Professor McKee.

** Career in IT
#+BEGIN_NOTES 

  After college, over 20 years ago, I wanted to pursue a career in IT.

  I decided to try a shortcut to breaking into the industry. I would get /*'certified'*/.

  There was just one problem.

  Despite 18 years of being a student, from pre-school to undergrad engineering degree, I had /*sparse*/ confidence in my own ability to efficiently learn.

  I signed up for a 6 month certification program, but delayed starting by 2 months, in order to study the fundamentals of adult education. 

  My brief studies about learning taught me to focus on demonstrating practical skill. 

  I purchased two computers from a trade show for $400, set them up with multiple boot configurations, and materialized every example in my text books into real world use cases.

  I also got a job at the certification office on the weekends, setting up workstations for the next week's courses, where I logged just over 2400 system installations.

  I was the first student to complete the local training program. I passed my tests with flying colors.

  I executed two successful job interviews in a row, allowing me to choose a place to begin my career.

  These actions were inspired by /investing/ 2 months of my life in learning about adult education.
   
  My shortcut driven efforts paid off in terms of personal finances, but were costly in another way.

  By succeeding at taking a shortcut, by taking the easy way, I reinforced a personal strategy that would cost precious time and money when I started to learn how to program, which I'll talk more about soon.

  The experience of learning about adult education was my first brush with learning about learning itself, but the profundity of it didn't sink in at the   time.

  It would be years later that I would look back and really glean wisdom from the experience.

** Finding Clojure 

 #+BEGIN_NOTES 
    My path to finding Clojure has been long and sometimes emotionally painful.

    Instead of structured struggle, much of the path has felt like needless struggle.

    I'd like to help other newcomers find their way before they suffer the bumps and bruises I've experienced. 

    I started programming at age 10.  By age 12, I was more interested in riding my bike than in staying inside the house.

    A few years ago, I started dabbling in programming again, in my spare time.

    I grew an interest in web applications, and had multiple ideas for potential businesses.

    I looked for 'easy' ways to make web apps.

    Even though the lessons I learned 20 years before about adult education were generally helpful, I picked up a way of thinking that needed to be unlearned.

    And given my sometimes stubborn nature, I had to learn the following lesson twice: Stop trying to do it the easy way!

    Twice, I tried to learn an 'easy' web framework, when I should have been focused on the fundamentals of programming.

    By the time I heard Rich Hickey's talk, Simple Made Easy, I was totally receptive to his message.

    In my own words, what I learned from him is that many approaches appear easy at first glance. But most /easy/ systems are actually highly complicated systems masquerading behind a thin veil of superficial usability.

    These systems will consume more time and resources the further a team gets into a greenfield project, before eventually grinding the progress of customization requests to a near halt.

    My main goal is to work with code and technology which facilitates understanding, allowing the team to focus on the domain problem at hand.

    I want to avoid being forced by my technology stack into saying, "No! Sorry, we can't do that, because the system won't allow it!"

    The main reason I've chosen Clojure is that I want to learn to think about the fundamentals of programming in the same way that Rich Hickey does - identities, values, time, these are his fundamental building blocks.

    Masters of a craft, discover, not only its essence, but how to practice it with great efficiency.

    While its true that professionals perform difficult tasks, they most certainly aren't doing them the hard way.

    Who are the professionals? What results are they achieving? And how are they achieving those results.

    I will save time, not by finding the easy way, but by mastering the fundamentals that bring very difficult problems within the reach of studious practitioners.

    Thank you Rich Hickey!

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Discovering the work of Betty Edwards was a eureka moment in my life, so its no surprise that she holds a prominent spot in my life's memory bank, from the home category of learning.

So how does Betty Edwards do it?

(NEXT FRAG 02-montage)

How does she accelerate the learning process of her drawing students so dramatically?

Betty Edwards teaches people 5 fundamental /seeing/ skills:

(NEXT FRAG)
How to *perceive* edges, spaces, relationship, lights & shadows and the gestalt (or whole).

Just as Rich Hickey, after years of studious practice, identified the fundamentals of software, Betty disentangled the basic building blocks of skill within the global skill of drawing.

After much practice and study, she had an aha! moment. These 5 subskills were it.

She researched the literature and found no additional fundamental components of the global skill of basic realistic drawing.

What if drawing could be taught and learned quickly, not over the course years?

Thus, with the help of her colleagues, Edwards developed a 5 day workshop to test her method.

The method was immediately validated by the workshop student's rapid progress.

Even more fascinating than what Edward's teaches her students is how she teaches it!

Edward's techniques revolve around understanding each brain hemisphere's role in the creative process, and employing the best suited hemisphere for the task at hand.

Her book, /Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain/, covers this subject with the detail it deserves, but I'll do my best to summarize.

Seeing is the domain of the right brain hemisphere.

This presents a unique challenge because, as the evidence Edward's compiles in her book indicates, the right brain is constantly being drowned out by left-brain activity, stimulated by our modern, technical, language-driven society.

This not only stymies our ability to draw, it dulls our general problem solving skills too.

Of course, the brain never really shuts half of itself completely off, but one half can be more active than the other.

Edward's calls these L-mode and R-mode to indicate which half is more active.

She's designed several unique exercises, such as drawing from a picture which is upside-down to trigger the R-mode.

Looking at an upside-down picture disrupts the left brain's habit of naming what is seen, so it loses interest which allows the right brain to step in and do what it's good at -- perceiving visually.

Betty Edwards' work ties in neatly with Rich Hickey's popular talk, /Hammock Driven Development/, in which he shares his process for solving big problems - engage the problem, then disengage, rinse and repeat. 

In her book, /Drawing on the Artist Within/, Betty Edward's deeply explores the the five stages of creativity:

First Insight, Saturation, Incubation, Illumination, and Verification.

First Insight is largely a right brain activity, where problems are identified and examined in a wordless, visual way.

This surveying of the surrounding world typically results in a question, such as "I wonder why ...?", or "I wonder if" etc.

This verbal articulation of a problem snaps the left-brain to attention in the second phase Saturation, so named because the left-brain saturates the brain with information and data that could be in any way related to the problem.

People have a tendency to hold onto a problem with an over-reliance on their conscious mental faculty.

Hence Rich Hickey's advice to try taking a nap in a Hammock once in a while.

When we finally do 'let go' of the problem, the right brain is able to resume work, only now with more information at hand.

This third phase is called Incubation, wherein the right brain, using it's spacial mapping prowess, connects the dots, and usually while the person is doing something else.

Aha! The illumination phase is a joint celebration between the left and right hemisphere's of the brain.

Some people report rapid heart rates and a profound sense of "things coming together".

As Betty Edward's states, "It is perhaps a moment when the whole human brain is suffused with joy."

Einstein described one his aha moments about gravity as "the happiest moment in my life". (source: Betty Edwards DRSOB pg 247, The cosmic Code, Hans Pagel)

Before we break out the dance music, there's work to do, hard work -- the final phase called Verification.

Both hemispheres play an active role in Verification, forming the creative epiphany into a finished product: whether that's an architectural model for a software system, a business plan or a report for school.

The left-brain methodically structures the product step by step, while the right-brain keeps an eye on the big picture.

Betty Edward's work was ahead of the formal brain science of the day when she began this journey.

We'll talk more about her soon, but for now I want to thank Betty Edwards for opening my eyes and helping me see the world more clearly!

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
   I have an ambitious goal. I want to be skilled in all aspects of creating a web app, from the front end to the back, using Clojure technologies, including ClojureScript, Datomic, React Native, Arachne and so on. 

   But first, the fundamentals! Identity, values, time.

   Forests emerge from a single tree, and a tree from a single seed.

   That's the essence of my message today -- planting seeds.

   Someone planted a seed in my mind over a year ago about taking the 4 hour online course, /Learning How to Learn/ by Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski.

   After slowly going through the course over many months, branching my studies off of the main curriculum by following the compass of my curiosity, I can say unequivocally taking this course has super-charged my learning!

   To my delight, it's helped me in ways I never expected. Yes, my learning skills are sharper and broader, and growing. 

   But I'm also sleeping better, eating better and enjoying playful breaks from my work to exercise in the back yard.

   Most profoundly, my relationships with family, friends and colleagues are flourishing, thanks to a better understanding of myself and others.

   But there's always room for improvement and as much as things have gotten better, its feels like this journey is just beginning.

   What I'm trying to say is I'm a *big* fan. 

   If I could plant just one seed today, it would be *this* course.

   The crucial benefit I've gained from my Learning How to Learn /studies/, is the confidence that I /will/ continue to improve my learning skills, which will accelerate learning in every other aspect of my life, including learning to program.

   Perhaps you're already confident in your ability to learn, and why shouldn't you be!?!

   After all you've gotten this far along in life, right!?!

   Fortunately, the brain comes pre-built to learn.

   The challenge then is this: can we learn to work with the natural 'grain' of the brain, can we learn even more efficiently? And what would our world look like if we did this en masse? 

   My hope is that you will find at least one thing in this talk that will help you in your own learning journey, whatever your goals may be.

   Toward that end I will touch on many aspects of the subject of learning. Each aspect can serve as a unique personal starting point, or fork in the road, for your own curiosity driven research.

It does, however, help to know that such incidental complexity has a purpose in Clojure, which is to keep unaware developers from shooting their toes off. This mentor related perspective helped me accept Clojure's complexity around Namespaces with more of an open mind, taking the sting out of it.

* Old Pitches 
** How can we best support the needs of Clojure learners? Imagine a future where a person interested in learning Clojure was presented with a menu of learning paths, each leading to well defined learning outcomes and offering various 'on-ramps' for learners of varying skill levels, especially, for learners completely new to programming. Imagine a future where every learner feels welcome and supported through supportive human relationships, from participation in users groups, educational co-ops, and especially one-on-one apprentice/mentor pairings. How can we place the needs of the learner above all else and grow Clojure to the scale of its full potential? Much progress has already been made, but what more can we do, together, to reach this goal?
** A community-centered brainstorming session facilitated by vulnerably sharing my unconventional ideas about learning to program, and graciously inviting others to share their own. An experiment in group problem solving applied to the problem of learning 'Clojure'.
*** 'Clojure' as used here is a heavily overloaded term, referring the body of knowledge encompassing Clojure(ish) technologies: ClojureScript, Datomic, React, React Native, bash/zshell, deployment technologies such as immutable infrastructure etc. etc. etc.
** I intend to foster an interactive conversation with my audience about how we can create stronger and more creative mentor/apprentice relationships in our growing community. The jumping off point would be my personal learning path of going from Hero to Zero. (Hero to Zero is a greatly overloaded term that is meaningful to me, but likely mysterious to others, so it will be a conversational thread wherein I can relay my personal experience of learning programming and Clojure.)


* Answers aren't everything
Questions are powerful on their own.

I think this one is worth revisiting again and again.

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
This question could have been tackled any number of ways. I stumbled upon this one by following my nose and trying not to fall behind on my deadline. 



I would enjoy revisiting the question anew, perhaps from a purely mathematical perspective. The options are endless, but decisions must be made, which by definition means possibilities are temporarily killed off. Decide - /de/ *to cull away* - /cide/ *to kill*. Like insecticide for the pesky ideas that don't fit the narrative, needs or time constraints of a project.

** The instrumental value of my learning based on 1000 point scale of importance.

* Why am I the person giving this talk?
*** TODO Long and documented history of putting my foot in my mouth
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Much of the talk is about the human brain, and almost anything I say about the brain that fits into an hour long talk will be grossly over-simplified. 
#+END_NOTES
*** TODO And thinking inside the box.
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Learning is like breathing -- we're always doing it. My thoughts on learning are being articulated through a lifetime of inherited and accumulated personal biases, many, if not most of which, I am probably unaware. That's why I need your help to unlock the potential discoveries of this fledgling research.
#+END_NOTES
*** Seriously though!  
#+BEGIN_NOTES
All joking aside, I'm deeply interested in this topic because learning to program, for me, has been a joy, but also a painful and lonely struggle. My experience and instincts tell that by the time most people discover Clojure, they've suffered needlessly for too long. I hope this talk can reach out and find aspiring learners at the outset of their learning journey. What can we do together to make learning Clojure a fantastic experience for everyone?
#+END_NOTES

* Clojure
**** Why Clojure - React Native holism etc.
*** Family, friends and human relationships
**** Vipassana Mediation - Understanding the mind/body commection
***** Anger and emotional turmoil is no respecter of religion or philosophy
*** Co-Intelligence & Futurism
**** TODO https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/03/31/dostoyevsky-reason-emotion/ find quote
*** Learning from failure yields long term success
Therefore learning, not winning is the greater value.
*** Know thyself, know others, 16 Personalities 
*** Learning about learning
There's a parallel between the drawings we saw at the start of this talk and the skill of learning, both are technical skills. I could poke around at drawing for years, or I could absorb the fundamentals from a master and use that framework to accelerate my progress.

That framework, as it turns out, is vitally important to genuine understanding. TODO University Study.
*** Learning is Adapting
And adapting is human. (Tie in Clojure connection)
* Could the keys to unlocking our human potential be hidden in the mysteries of the human brain?
*** Decide for yourself after we explore recent discoveries, including powerful new insights in motivation and procrastination.
**** How can science's new understanding of the placebo effect dramatically increase our chances of successfully mastering highly technical skills?

That's just a taste of what we'll talk about in the next hour.

* Research
** Education: https://educarenow.wordpress.com/
*** educare (latin): To draw out that which lies within.
*** Contrast ecurare definition to that of Education: The process of receiving or giving systematic instruction, especially at a school or university.
** Adult Education https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_education
*** Purpose: Vocational, Social, Recreational, Self-development: Ultimately to achieve human fulfillment

** Tweeting

*** QR to Tweet http://qrickit.com/qrickit_apps/qrickit_qrcode_creator_tweet.php

*** Click to tweet https://clicktotweet.com/

*** DONE Talk, when viewed on video, will still allow people to tweet pre-defined statements or questions by scanning qr codes and submitting ideas.

** Org Mode notes
*** After opening notes.org on my system, I usually ~SPC t l~ and then ~SPC t L~ to get things looking good.
    Truncating lines and visual breaks. Nice. If you want, you can establish those settings as defaults in your config file. Can use `SPC-?` (Helm describes bindings) to figure out the proper names.
** Separation of TODOs 
*** Below I've tagged this todo with isaac10, meaning its for you with a priority of 10 (lower number is higher priority and they go up by 10. That's an old basic programming trick which makes it easy to stick other todos inbetween, after the fact).
And it avoids the alphabetization problem of 0's! Sweet!
*** DONE isaac10 Please study up on how to wrangle css for reveal.js so we can get page elements where we want them.
    CLOSED: [2017-02-02 Thu 09:40]
**** DONE Page element most concerned about is title at top left, space for video top right, paragraph/bullets left aligned half way down from top for first line. 
     CLOSED: [2017-02-02 Thu 09:40]
**** DONE These are subtasks under the main task, so they would also be for you unless my name is next the subtask.
     CLOSED: [2017-02-02 Thu 09:40]
**** This system should work pretty good unless we run into git workflow issues, in which case we can move out to email etc.
**** DONE items can be placed anywhere in the file so when you git pull you can just do a text search for "isaac" and bingo! :)
     CLOSED: [2017-02-02 Thu 09:40]
**** Thank you! I'll create a new subheading under Jay & Isaac called Isaac Projects where we can keep your big picture stuff.
**** DONE Great!

Jay, I've got one stand-in solution for the top left h2 placement for now, using strictly CSS. And now that we've got custom JS involved too, we've got a lot of options for much more fine-grained and DOM-aware control.
**** DONE isaac20 research then tinker with getting webcam image as part of web page. (This might be tricky with reveal.js. Not sure how to best do it?)

***** I found this https://www.kirupa.com/html5/accessing_your_webcam_in_html5.htm
See email question about p2p video streaming.
***** In the mean time, you can just use a blll have a lot more controlank white rectangle to act as place holder.
***** On the title screen, the video would look better on the left. Not a high priority right now.
***** reach out and let me know how things are going, if they are unclear, or to ask any questions :)
*** TODO isaac300 research doing footnotes in org-mode. There's something called Bibtex too. (notice low priority)
*** Reveal notes
Setting the REVEAL_ROOT as a relative path above works for me, but is inconsistent with https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal. 
;; #+OPTIONS: reveal_width:1920 reveal_height:1080
;; note: function: org-toggle-inline-images   (toggles between showing images in buffer and showing text url of images file)
;; reveal_center:t 
note that I used two SPACES after the * to make the invisible heading for the non-title title slide.
#+mynotes: Use Big John / Little Joe for Headings, Quicksand for normal type and lobster for marking up pictures (or any combination of these.
