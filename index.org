 #+BEGIN_NOTES 
 Thank you Ryan. I'm super happy to be here at Clojure Remote 2017.  Welcome to each of you that are with us today to talk about /The Value of Learning/.

 My goal today is to /*start*/ an ongoing conversation, within the Clojure community and beyond, about the /*art and science*/ of learning.

 I see myself as more of a facilitator than a leader. What if the group of us here today could co-create an experience, over the next hour, that would serve the Clojure community for years to come? Attracting people to Clojure who've never even heard of it?

 Imagine someone finding the /Value of Learning/ video on YouTube, the video you and I are already making together right this very minute. How will they find us? Probably a search about learning, right? So we know something about these people we've never met. They're interested in learning! And so are you or wouldn't be here right now. So we all have something in common, we value learning.

 Turns out, that many people are interested in this topic. Millions and millions of people have taken the learning how to learn course. How many of them want to write an app? Or learn to program. Probably most!


 As a community, we in Clojure, should think of this searcher of learning as an honored guest. What is it that we have to offer them? We could start with the basics:

 "Clojure is a general-purpose programming language, which means you can use it to do almost anything you can imagine." According to clojure.org "Clojure has a set of useful features that together form a simple, coherent, and powerful tool."

 I might follow this up by saying, "Have you noticed lately how a lot of the technology we use today doesn't always behave the way we expect it to. Trust me it's not you. Software isn't anywhere near as reliable as it should be. In Clojure, we believe you increase reliability by building software in a fundamentally simpler way. This simplicity doesn't mean Clojure is easier to learn than other languages. It might not be. But it's an incredibly powerful language. And here's one big reason why:

  Clojure's a hosted language which means it  adapts to its host environments, which also include any web browser, like the one on that phone in your pocket, and also Java and .NET environments. These three places are where most software in the entire world gets built to run which means Clojure can run alongside these languages or instead of them in the host environment.

 Clojure has a reputation of rock solid reliability, while remaining super flexible. This may be its greatest unsung superpower. You see, languages come in two types, static and dynamic. Static languages are very safe because the system knows what type of thing every /*thing*/ in the system is. Dynamic languages allow things to change more fluidly in the system, and as the name implies they allow a lot more cool stuff to happen while the program is running; dynamic stuff, like changing the innards of the running program itself. Rick Hickey, Clojure's author, came up with a 3rd way, heretofore undiscovered in the field of language design. We call it Spec which is short for specify and it allows to you to 'specify' which things in the system need you care to quality check, and which you don't.


 You don't need to understand everything I'm about to say to appreciate the point I'm driving at, that 
Clojure is a community which fosters high impact innovation.

 What impact would it have on Clojure's growth if each of us were as fluent in the language of learning as we are in Clojure itself?

 How attractive would Clojure be to the next wave of new programmers, entrepreneurs and open source authors, if each of us were expert teachers? 

 Learning and teaching are technical skills which can be honed like any other skill. This is a new way of thinking about learning for me. And it's also really good news. You see, even after 19 years of education, from pre-school to a degree in engineering, I had sparse confidence in my ability to learn technical knowledge and skills, like programming. Why is that?

 Today, I'm learning more effectively than ever before, but more importantly I'm preserving my emotional energy for enjoying life more, by worrying less about my next learning challenge.

 After my own experience, I now believe that anyone can dramatically improve their ability to learn any subject, relative to their current ability. You might think you're just not inherently good at drawing, or writing, or math, or you're not athletic, or you can't sing or hum a tune. That's the way it is and that's that.

 Simply put, brain science says otherwise. We'll invest the next hour of our time to explore the nuance of this claim. 

 Being a part of the Clojure community has really inspired me to up my learning game. Rich Hickey's talk /Hammock Driven Development/, which is laden with learning wisdom, led me to the /Learning How to Learn/ online course, which we'll talk about in the third and final part of the talk.  

 We'll get back to Clojure in a minute but first I want to /draw/ you into this whole learning thing. Check this out:

 5 days. These people, people not unlike you or me, learned the technical fundamentals of drawing in only 5 days. 
 
 Personally, I'm astonished by these drawings.
 
 This rapid learning reminds of a scene in The Matrix, where Neo and Trinity see a helicopter.

 He asks her "Can you fly that thing?"

 With stoic confidence she replies, "Not yet".

 Moments later she is skillfully flying the aircraft.

 How does Betty Edwards facilitate such efficient progress for her students?
 
 And how is her approach relevant to learning other highly technical skills, such as programming?
 
 We'll explore these, and other questions, over the next hour, but first let's frame up the conversation.

We're at a Clojure Conference, and I'm a Clojure enthusiast, so we'll definitely be talking about Clojure, but you don't even have to know what Clojure is to get something out of this talk, or to participate.

Are you interested in solving problems, making things, the subject of creativity, or learning? 

Whatever your interests, your presence and ideas are greatly valued.

For the sake of today's conversation I'll refer this audience as falling in one of 2 broad categories: programmers and makers.  This programmer persona learns several programming languages rather deeply, while the maker wants to narrow the scope of their learning focus to the immediate business or open source project. Please forgive the over generalizations.

In 10 minutes, I'll give you more instructions on how you can participate in this conversation, even if you're watching this on video months or years from now.

A little hint: Have your smart device handy if it has a QR code scanner. If not, there will be other ways you can get involved.

But first, please let me tell you about a problem I need your help with. The next 10 minutes of context building will help you better understand the problem, as I see it.

** Clojure and me

#+BEGIN_NOTES
I enjoy the challenge of programming, but for me programming is a means to an end. I want to invent. Daily. I want to solve problems big and small. As a new-ish programmer I will cut my teeth on many small acorn projects before trying to grow an oak tree on my first go.

At heart I'm either an inventor, or an entrepreneur and I'm figuring out which side of the line I favor, as I duck walk straddling the two. My heart is also in open source, and I want to join in the solving of big, existentially relevant problems, but first I'm cutting my teeth on the fundamentals of programming, thanks to Rich Hickey.

In a rather chaotic fashion, I'm learning the Basic Student Language in Dr. Racket, Clojure, Datomic, Arachne, ClojureScript, React Native, Datsys, HTML, CSS, Git, Github, JavaScript, Docker, Boxfuse, Drawing, Design, Subform and a handful of other things. No wonder the github logo is an octopus!

That's a lot of stuff to learn, and I've discovered that I'm not as organized as I could be, but part of that is that I've expended great energy and time in just finding the way of programming that solves the problems I've grown to care about.

By the time I heard Rich Hickey's talk, Simple Made Easy, I was totally receptive to his message.
 
Datomic was the reason I chose Clojure. In my limited experience working with an object oriented language, I didn't like having to flatten nested data beyond recognition, just to fit it into tables and rows to satisfy query performance, which froze the computer of the expert programmer I hired to help me build the prototype at hand. Most of my ideas involve nested data structures of at least 7 or 8, user-relevant domain entities, such as meals comprising recipes comprising ingredients and so on. 

My main goal is to work with code and technology which facilitates understanding, allowing the team to focus on the domain problem at hand.

To my business spidey-senses, this is the most effective to minimize costs. Adding another language into the mix, brings in a largely different way of thinking, not to mention package management, documentation, upgrades and on and on.

But I also don't want the project to be needlessly constrained down the road by choosing technologies based solely on aesthetics. My early choices must not severely limit the scope of future, yet unknown problems and needs.

Ideally, I'd never have to say no to myself or a customer based solely on my core technology stack.

By the time I heard Rich Hickey's talk, Simple Made Easy, I was totally receptive to his message.
  
In my own words, what I learned from him is that many approaches appear easy at first glance. But most /easy/ systems are actually highly complicated systems masquerading behind a thin veil of superficial usability.

There's significant risk, if not, high probability that these 'easy' systems will consume more time and resources the further a team gets into a greenfield project, before eventually grinding the progress of new work to a grind.

The biggest reason I chose Clojure is that I want to learn to think about the fundamentals of programming in the same way that Rich Hickey does - identities, values, time, these are his fundamental building blocks.

Masters of a craft, discover, not only its essence, but how to practice it with great efficiency.

While its true that professionals perform difficult tasks, they most certainly aren't doing them the hard way. Grace defines their movement.

Who are the professionals? What results are they achieving? And how are they achieving those results. 

I will save time, not by finding the easy way, but by mastering the fundamentals that bring very difficult problems within the reach of studious Clojure practitioners.

My needs are different from the programmer, who likely needs to learn to program in several industry standard languages.

I'm not advocating mono-culture, but rather trying to reach makers, that aren't finding us, or aren't seeing the value of Clojure, or are seeing it but are wary of the road less traveled, and the hiring implications that might have for their future business.

But how is this relevant to you? I believe that we need to reach makers where they are, instead of waiting for people to come to us.

Rich Hickey says that even the best juggler in the world can only juggle 11 balls. What about average jugglers? How are makers supposed to succeed wildly while juggling dozens of complex system components? We can spare them the need to learn this the hard if we can offer them a better path.

Right now, most don't make it to Clojure's front door, but the ones that do are often greeted with news of Clojure's steeper than average learning curve.

#+BEGIN_NOTES 

    Rich Hickey, in his talk /Simple Made Easy/ acknowledges that Clojure has a higher learning curve than other languages. Fortunately, learning and teaching already define the essence of this community, from the mind-expanding talks, to the daily exchanges of thinking through a problem with a peer, in person or online, its really one big, ongoing conversation. 

    To a person, everyone in this community that I've asked for help has generously shared their knowledge to help me learn. And to a person, everyone I've met is pretty keen on Clojure. 
    
    We don't just love Clojure. We love what it does for us. Clojure has a lot in common with human learning. As a hosted language, Clojure not only *adapts* to most any general problem imaginable, it adapts to all the right platforms: from the Java Virtual Machine to the Common Language Runtime, the browser and beyond.
 
    Clojure's reach and generality are among its greatest strengths, but they are also the reason it has a higher learning curve than other *individual* languages. I stress individual languages because there's a strong case to be made that Clojure's generality, which brings Clojure's powerful idioms to the server and browser, is a steadily increasing advantage in Clojure's favor. 

    Whatever the actual case, those of us here today believe any extra effort is worth it.

    There's a palpable buzz going on in the community right now, and the pace of innovation is awe inspiring to see and be a part of.

    This past year I've met several Clojure developers who looked me in the eye and said, "Clojure is the reason I now enjoy doing what I'm doing. I'm not sure I'd still be doing this without it".

    I met someone who maintains a popular open source project. I asked him how much work it was to maintain. He said calmly, 'it just works.' These conversations have been very reassuring to me as an open source enthusiast and aspiring entrepreneur.
    
    There's a world full of interesting and vital problems out there, waiting to be solved. How much of Clojure's awesomeness will get put to use on these problems? How much will go to waste? 

    I met a fellow entrepreneur at a recent Clojure Conference.

    Our projects have similar technology needs, so we decided to collaborate on a core Clojure stack that would meet our shared needs. We've both done a lot of research on different languages and approaches, but I'm a year into my part-time Clojure studies, whereas she is a couple of months in.

    Upon leaving the Clojure conference, both of us were really excited to work together and to use Clojure.

    Recently though she's expressed an interest in using Elixir for her MVP.

    Why? Because its easier to learn.

    Lowering the barrier to entry into our community is a vital task, and I know that many of you have been working on this problem for years, which is why its easier to get started now than ever.

    Sometimes though, I think we can get so close to a problem that we get stuck in our thinking. This talk is designed to help you turn this problem upside down and look at, really look at it, in a new light.

    If you're an experienced Clojure developer, you can add wisdom and experience to my raw naivete. If you're new to the community, you're fresh perspective and feedback are valuable assets.

    If there's a group of people in the world who can solve this problem, it's you. If you're up for the challenge, please listen to the talk with the problem of Clojure's learning curve in the back of your mind. Are we missing something obvious?

   What are my qualifications for giving this talk?

   I'm speaking to you today as a layperson.

   And if I've learned anything about this subject, its that learning is full of paradox.

   It often results from a process of reconciliation between competing ideas or ways of thinking.

   Almost any statement of truth I might profess about learning, can probably be argued the other way as well.
 
   This wasn't readily apparent to me when I began this project, but its crystal clear to me now.

   And I'm more humble for the effort.

   Fortunately, I have a long and

   (NEXT FRAG) documented history of putting my foot in my mouth.

   This talk aims to kick start an ongoing conversation about our individual and shared experiences of learning.

   While researching this talk, many people have shared with me their own learning experiences with insight and candor.

   My hope is that by candidly sharing my learning experiences publicly, other people might identify with my learning triumphs and struggles, and that together we might be able find a better way of tackling some of our common problems around learning and teaching.

   Scattered throughout the talk, you'll notice a red pill appear on the lower right corner of the screen.

   Each pill contains a QR code.

   These red-pills lead to mini-polls, links to kick-start your research, or pre-filled tweets that will serve to network like minds around the subject of learning.

   Even if you're watching this on video, months or years from now, you can still participate by scanning the red pills with your smart phone.

   If you don't have a smart phone handy, or if you're watching this on your smart phone, you can relax and enjoy the show because we'll be converting the presentation into an interactive web site soon.

   If you're curious about the tech stack behind the talk, it was written in emacs org mode and exported to reveal.js using org-reveal.

   Isaac Ardis, a web developer and new friend, has been a tremendous help with the development and content you'll see.

   All of our work is available at the-value-of-learning github repository.

   Scan the red pill now if you'd like to get the URL of our github repository saved in your browser history.

   We're going to explore several aspects of learning through the framework of learning's /*worth*/.

How does she accelerate the learning process of her drawing students so dramatically?

Betty Edwards teaches people 5 fundamental /seeing/ skills:

(NEXT FRAG)
How to *perceive* edges, spaces, relationship, lights & shadows and the gestalt (or whole).

Just as Rich Hickey, after years of studious practice, identified the fundamentals of software, Betty identified the basic building blocks within the skill of drawing.

After much practice and study, she had an aha! moment. These 5 subskills were it.

What if drawing could be taught and learned quickly, not over the course years?

Her method was validated by the rapid progress of her students.

Edward's techniques revolve around understanding each brain hemisphere's role in the creative process, and employing the best suited hemisphere for the task at hand.

#+BEGIN_NOTES

Her book, /Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain/, covers this subject with the detail it deserves, but I'll do my best to summarize.

Seeing is the domain of the right brain hemisphere.

This presents a unique challenge because, as the evidence Edward's compiles in her book indicates, the right brain is constantly being drowned out by left-brain activity, stimulated by our modern, technical, language-driven society.

This not only stymies our ability to draw, it dulls our general problem solving skills too.

Of course, the brain never really shuts half of itself completely off, but one half can be more active than the other.

She's designed several unique exercises, such as drawing from a picture which is upside-down to enhance right brain activity.

#+BEGIN_NOTES

Looking at an upside-down picture disrupts the left brain's habit of naming what is seen, so it loses interest which allows the right brain to step in and do what it's good at -- perceiving visually.

The left-brain methodically structures the product step by step, while the right-brain keeps an eye on the big picture.

What does her work imply for programmers? Are we supposed to turn our code upside and stare at it?

According to Edward's, perceptual skills translate to general problem solving skills.

Perceiving edges and relationships between the conceptual components of any problem are vital skills toward solving that problem. As are seeing the whole and subtleties, i.e. the lights and shadows.

In her book, /Drawing on the Artist Within/, Betty Edward's deeply explores the the five stages of creativity which initiate from a question held in mind and crescendo in the /Illumination/ phase, more widely known as the aha! moment :

The illumination phase is a joint celebration between the left and right hemisphere's of the brain.

Some people report rapid heart rates and a profound sense of "things coming together".

As Betty Edward's states, "It is perhaps a moment when the whole human brain is suffused with joy."

Einstein described one of his aha moments about gravity as "the happiest moment in my life". 

We can summarize the work of Betty Edward's by saying that her students progress so rapidly because they are learning the essential fundamental skills of seeing.

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted. -- Bertrand Russell
  #+END_QUOTE

  #+BEGIN_NOTES

 Before we assess the central question of this talk, let me /try/ to clarify the question.

 /Education/ is often touted as a panacea to to the world's problems.

 Over time, I've observed that different people mean different things when saying these exact same words.

 Learning is obviously important, but when we talk about learning, what do we mean?

 School? College? Career? Breathing?

 Okay, fortunately some things come to us quite naturally.

 At first glance, the question "What is the value of learning?" appears to be quite basic. 

 It was Bertrand Russell who said, "In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted."

 I believe that we have a lot to gain, and nothing to lose, by applying Russell's wisdom to the subject of learning.

 Invisible values risk becoming neglected values.

 If we persist in repeating the mantra "education is the answer", without periodically reflecting on it's meaning, the words begin to ring hollow and lose their power.

 My hope is that by thoughtfully assessing the value of learning for ourselves, we can discover something new, something overlooked, and gain insight into the invisible value of learning.

** Brain, the invisible organ
 #+BEGIN_NOTES 

 While learning may be the invisible value, the brain is the invisible organ. At least that's my explanation of why, in my youth, I was *not* very interested in the brain, or how I could use it to improve my life.

 For all its potential power, surely there /must be/ some explanation why I wasn't in awe of the brain.

 A couple of reasons have come to mind:

 In my case, the brain science of the day said that once a human embryo was fully developed the brain had a fixed number of brain cells, and no new cells would ever be produced.

 The message behind the message, to my ear, was "You can't get any smarter. You're either smart or you're not."

 And maybe there's another reason why the brain goes unappreciated to kids -- the brain has to compete with a heartbeat.

 As a very young child, the heartbeat was a constant reminder, "I have a heart!"

 It just so happens that each of us, by better understanding how our brains function, can work 'with the grain' of the brain to improve both our intuition, which  is associated with our 'gut instinct', and our emotional intelligence, which has long been the associated with the heart. 

 Maybe the brain just needs better PR.

The history of the word value goes all the way back to the Latin, /valēre/, which means *to be well* or *have strength*.

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
/Learning/ means *the activity or process of gaining knowledge or skill by studying, practicing, being taught, or experiencing something*.

According to the definition, gaining knowledge or skill is the goal of learning.

Knowledge or skill. I like how simple that sounds, but is it too simple. Can we learn new ways of being or behaving. For example, can I raise my 'average mood' or lower my anxiety?  These might considered skills too, I suppose.

Also according to the definition, there are a handful of ways to gain knowledge or skill: study, practice, observation, and experience.

The history of the word /learn/ goes back all the way back to the latin word /lira/ which means *furrow* or *track*.

The word furrow really sticks out to me. A furrow is *a long trench*. But not just any trench! *a long narrow trench in the ground made by a plow, especially for planting seeds*. 

The latin meaning is my new, favorite way to think about learning -- planting a long trail of seeds, seeds of knowledge and skill, which will grow and flourish in time! How cool is that!?!

** Two faces of education
- Outside In
- Inside Out

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
The meaning of the word education is multifaceted, stemming from the two branches of its latin roots.

These two faces of education can be generally described as /Outside In/ & /Inside Out/. 

(NEXT SLIDE DOWN)

.

.

.
#+END_NOTES


*** Outside In
educare: to train or mold

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
The latin /educare/ means: to train or mold.

Proponents of the "outside in" perspective of education seek to impart knowledge and form students by shaping them according to templates of idealized virtues and skill.

As in, "The University educates its students by giving them knowledge."

(NEXT SLIDE DOWN)

.

.

.
#+END_NOTES

*** Inside Out
educere: to lead out

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
The latin /educere/ means: *to lead out*.

Advocates of the "inside out" perspective of education seek to prepare the student for the unpredictable challenges of the future by focusing the pupil's attention on the process of acquiring new skills and knowledge.

As in, "The students education is evident in their lifelong curiosity about the world in which they live."

Both faces of education likely have their ideal time and place.

It seems we are in the early stages of discovering an ideal balance between the two, especially regarding our new information driven world.

# Isaac says:
# 1. Citing falling standardize test scores in critique of outside-in learning is self-contradictory.
# 2. Japan is not exactly known to be a student's paradise. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/uloop/japans-education-disaster_b_8691650.html
# 3. Germany also places a great emphasisis on individual standardized test performance, and initiates 'tracking' very early (from 8th grade?) based on scores. France similarly.
# 4. Perhaps Finland is a more effective example? http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/why-are-finlands-schools-successful-49859555/
# 5. You may be pointing to a very deep rift. Some extreme collegiate examples: a.) Reed College vs. b.) MIT. Or... a Waldof+/Montessori methods vs. some of the magnet+charter schools in New York (think uniforms, discipline, per-second schedules). There are examples of both outperforming peers, despite widely varying methods. There are two challenges being adressed: one is cultivating independent, creative, resourceful and innovative thinking, the other developing technical, formal, and canonical precision and regularity. In any case, these couple of sentences below bely challenges and reminiscences worth book, even lifetimes of them. I would be careful about hard-and-fast conclusions. Forgive me if I'm being too forward.

** Review the question
What is the value of learning?
# Isaac: In light of needing to sculpt some mass away, this might be an area of reconsideration. 
# A discussion of the historico-philosophico-logistics of axiology seems somewhat out of place, given a focus on "learning about learning"... perhaps leading unnecessarily towards "learning about valuation systems".
 
# In light of this (and as background for my reasoning), I might offer that, in fact, learning is unavoidable. It a necessary and functionally fundamental part of being human (or even a mouse). Scientifically speaking, it might be considered that learning can be described as the brain "re-wiring" itself in response to stimulus. And the brain is _always_ rewiring, and we are never without stimulous.[fn:ft-wt] We are _essentially_ plastic (in the material-behavior sense).
# [fn:ft-wt]: "Fire-together, wire-together," is a common neurosciency mantra. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory

# Given this, the challenge of _valuing_ my own learning extends to the reaches of valuing my _self_, which seems out of context from a more tangible and pragmatic perspective on "learning about learning." 
 
# Instead, it may be worth bringing attention to questions like "_How_ are you learning? What does that look like?", "How does that compare to how you worked in school (where 'learning' is the supposed _MO_)?", "When, and what do you teach?" "What challenges do you face as a student or a teacher in the context of Clojure?"
 
# Which might lead nicely into The Actions, and open a door to considering learning in regard to Clojure and it's people.

# **************

# Jay to Isaac. I really like the thrust of what you're driving at. I'll be incorporating the spirit of your ideas of 'how' within the context of telling the story of "trying" to measure value of learning, and treasuring the insights that failure led to more than some arbitary mathematical answer, such 42.

The philosophical study of value.

Pursuing this question led me to the field of axiology, which is the philosophical study of value.

This study dates back to the time of ancient Greece, when Plato first wrote about the distinction between intrinsic value and instrumental value.

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Value theory is a modern approach to understanding value. It stems from axiology, but seeks to determine value through scientific observation.

What do people value and why? Psychology, sociology and economics each provide a unique lens through which to study value.

For example, a sociologist might be interested in how different groups of people value learning similarly or differently.

An economist might choose to measure the value of learning in terms of goods and services related to learning which are sold in the marketplace.

A psychologist might seek to measure the value of learning by categorizing learning subjects according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

At this point in my research, I thought of a potential shortcut to answering the question. What if we could prove that learning was harmful?

We're in the age of information. Knowledge streams across the internet at up to two thirds the speed of light. Isn't it possible that malicious actors could use this information destructively?

I'm learning to program, and I want to help others learn too. Are these actions helping society or are they hurting?

This is an important question! If they're hurting, I should cease and desist now.

So, /*is*/ learning harmful?

Upon asking this question, I struck gold in finding the article (NEXT FRAG) /Is knowledge "good" or "neutral"?/

The author, Piotr Wozniak, raises some of the same questions I was asking myself about malicious actors in the world.

Wozniak claims that Knowledge is good.

The article supports this claim by elaborating in great detail over a simple five-step chain of reasoning.

Wozniak argues that humans benefit through cooperation and lose out on conflict, and claims this truth can be demonstrated mathematically with the tools of game theory.

We don't have time to walk through his reasoning in detail, but I highly recommend this article as an exercise in critical thinking.

After reading the article, I noticed that I felt a bit more lighthearted in my work.

I feel like its helped relieve my cognitive dissonance about facilitating technological advances for our society.

Although I'm still quite curious about how this line of reasoning will hold up against artificial intelligence.

Wozniak's article also serves as a gentle introduction to axiology and value theory.

There are three major systems of value: hedonism, religion and scientific axiology.

Hedonism values pleasure and devalues pain. It's been around since multi-celled organisms developed nervous systems.

Religion uses faith and reason to ascribe value.

And Scientific axiology strives to measure value using only the scientific method. 

All other systems of value can be categorized within or among these three.

Most people apply a conglomeration of these three value systems to evaluate their goals.

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
How can I measure the value I place on learning?

Before I reveal my method, I'd like to offer this disclaimer.

This is my first stab at the problem and the method is far from perfect.

There are simpler methods, but they would require more time, time I didn't have in preparing for this talk.

The simplest method I could think of would be to measure how much time in a given month do I dedicate specifically to learning.

Unfortunately, I don't have a month to spare, so please excuse the complexity of my next best solution. Drum roll please...

The method I've chosen aims to quantify the role of learning in my life.

My general strategy is to look back over my life, identify significant memories, and try to assign a quantifiable value to that memory somehow.

How can I break this big problem up in to smaller pieces?

Inspired by Maslow's hierarchical pyramid of needs, I've divided my life into 10 major categories.

(NEXT FRAG)

These are: Health, Family, Friends, Community, Romance / Art, Career / Business, Fun / Hobbies/ Recreation, Philosophical / Spiritual, Personal Finance, Personal Development & Learning.

These categories serve a dual purpose.

First, they serve as a way for me to look back on my life memories and recall stories that relate to a given category, which I will call the home category.

Second, they serve as a way to quantify value, where each category will be worth 100 points.

In fairness, I want to recall the same number of stories from each category.

Each memory has the potential to impact between 1 and 10 life categories.

If a memory affects multiple categories, the home category of that memory will score 100 points for each affected category, and each affected category will score 100 points for being "tagged" by that memory.

For example, if a memory from the learning category about learning to ride my bike affects 3 categories, Fun, Family and Learning, then the home category of of learning will earn 300 points, and the other two categories Fun and Family will earn 100 points each.

In this way, categories earn points for playing a role in my significant life memories. 

The logic behind this strategy is that a memory which stands out in my mind is a valuable memory, otherwise I would have forgotten about it.

The obvious exceptions are painful memories, like when I broke my arm, which will be filtered out, unless they have some obvious life value.

As you can imagine, this process has the potential to bring up deeply personal memories, and lucky for you we don't have time for my entire life story.

Instead I've curated a short list of memories which are relevant to this talk.

I'll use 2 or 3 of the following stories as examples of how I scored memories according to described method.

Where should we start? How about near the beginning?

** Finding Clojure 

 #+BEGIN_NOTES 
    My path to finding Clojure has been long and sometimes emotionally painful.

    Instead of productive struggle, much of the path has felt like needless struggle.

    I'd like to help other newcomers find their way before they suffer the bumps and bruises I've experienced. 

    I started programming at age 10.  By age 12, I was more interested in riding my bike than in staying inside the house.

    A few years ago, I started dabbling in programming again, in my spare time.

    I grew an interest in web applications, and had multiple ideas for potential businesses.

    I looked for 'easy' ways to make web apps.

    Even though the lessons I learned 20 years before about adult education were generally helpful, I picked up a way of thinking that needed to be unlearned.

    And given my sometimes stubborn nature, I had to learn the following lesson twice: Stop trying to do it the easy way!

    Twice, I tried to learn an 'easy' web framework, when I should have been focused on the fundamentals of programming.

    By the time I heard Rich Hickey's talk, Simple Made Easy, I was totally receptive to his message.

    In my own words, what I learned from him is that many approaches appear easy at first glance. But most /easy/ systems are actually highly complicated systems masquerading behind a thin veil of superficial usability.

    These systems will consume more time and resources the further a team gets into a greenfield project, before eventually grinding the progress of customization requests to a near halt.

    My main goal is to work with code and technology which facilitates understanding, allowing the team to focus on the domain problem at hand.

    I want to avoid being forced by my technology stack into saying, "No! Sorry, we can't do that, because the system won't allow it!"

    The main reason I've chosen Clojure is that I want to learn to think about the fundamentals of programming in the same way that Rich Hickey does - identities, values, time, these are his fundamental building blocks.

    Masters of a craft, discover, not only its essence, but how to practice it with great efficiency.

    While its true that professionals perform difficult tasks, they most certainly aren't doing them the hard way.

    Who are the professionals? What results are they achieving? And how are they achieving those results.

    I will save time, not by finding the easy way, but by mastering the fundamentals that bring very difficult problems within the reach of studious practitioners.

    There is something special about the Clojure community to me.

    There's a very strong focus on learning and teaching in this community. From Russ Olsen's keynote, /Eloquent Explanations/ to 

    Rich Hickey's talk /Hammock Driven Development/, which is what got me started on this whole chain of research about learning in the first place.

    Not to mention that to a person, each and every one of you that I've met, share your knowledge generously. And I gotta say it, you're just some darn interesting people!

    I believe our community has a great challenge in front of us.

    Rich Hickey himself acknowledges that Clojure has a higher learning curve than other languages.

    Of course, those of us here today believe the extra effort is worth it. 

    We don't just love Clojure. We love what it does for us.

    Clojure has a lot in common with human learning. As a hosted language, Clojure not only adapts to any general problem imaginable, it adapts to all the right platforms, the JVM, the CLR, Node.js, the browser! Thank you Clojure Script!
    
    Even so, all this greatness is at risk of not being widely adopted if new programmers and entrepreneurs are turned off at square one.

    I met a fellow entrepreneur at a recent Clojure Conj.

    She and I have similar projects and are considering joining forces to split up the work.

    After playing around with Elixir, she's considering going that route for her MVP.

    Why? Because its easier to learn.

    Clojure could do a better job of attracting and retaining greenfield entrepreneurs like her.

    Lowering the barrier to entry would be good for everyone, not just entrepreneurs. 

    I know many of you have been working on this for years and the progress you've made is beyond commendable.

    If there's a group of people in the world who can solve this problem, it's you.

    Just as Rich Hickey and friends are disentangling the problem of software, learning experts are doing the same in their field.

    Can we leverage their discoveries to make learning Clojure the absolute best learning experience for programmers around the planet?

    I think we can.

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
How can I measure the value I place on learning?

Before I reveal my method, I'd like to offer this disclaimer.

This is my first stab at the problem and the method is far from perfect.

There are simpler methods, but they would require more time, time I didn't have in preparing for this talk.

The simplest method I could think of would be to measure how much time in a given month do I dedicate specifically to learning.

Unfortunately, I don't have a month to spare, so please excuse the complexity of my next best solution. Drum roll please...

The method I've chosen aims to quantify the role of learning in my life.

My general strategy is to look back over my life, identify significant memories, and try to assign a quantifiable value to that memory somehow.

How can I break this big problem up in to smaller pieces?

Inspired by Maslow's hierarchical pyramid of needs, I've divided my life into 10 major categories.

(NEXT FRAG)

These are: Health, Family, Friends, Community, Romance / Art, Career / Business, Fun / Hobbies/ Recreation, Philosophical / Spiritual, Personal Finance, Personal Development & Learning.

These categories serve a dual purpose.

First, they serve as a way for me to look back on my life memories and recall stories that relate to a given category, which I will call the home category.

Second, they serve as a way to quantify value, where each category will be worth 100 points.

In fairness, I want to recall the same number of stories from each category.

Each memory has the potential to impact between 1 and 10 life categories.

If a memory affects multiple categories, the home category of that memory will score 100 points for each affected category, and each affected category will score 100 points for being "tagged" by that memory.

For example, if a memory from the learning category about learning to ride my bike affects 3 categories, Fun, Family and Learning, then the home category of of learning will earn 300 points, and the other two categories Fun and Family will earn 100 points each.

In this way, categories earn points for playing a role in my significant life memories. 

The logic behind this strategy is that a memory which stands out in my mind is a valuable memory, otherwise I would have forgotten about it.

The obvious exceptions are painful memories, like when I broke my arm, which will be filtered out, unless they have some obvious life value.

As you can imagine, this process has the potential to bring up deeply personal memories, and lucky for you we don't have time for my entire life story.

Instead I've curated a short list of memories which are relevant to this talk.

I'll use 2 or 3 of the following stories as examples of how I scored memories according to described method.

Where should we start? How about near the beginning?

* New goal
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
   I have an ambitious goal. I want to be skilled in all aspects of creating a web app, from the front end to the back, using Clojure technologies, including ClojureScript, Datomic, React Native, Arachne and so on. 

   But first, the fundamentals! Identity, values, time.

   Forests emerge from a single tree, and a tree from a single seed.

   That's the essence of my message today -- planting seeds.

   Someone planted a seed in my mind over a year ago about taking the 4 hour online course, /Learning How to Learn/ by Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski.

   After slowly going through the course over many months, branching my studies off of the main curriculum by following the compass of my curiosity, I can say unequivocally taking this course has super-charged my learning!

   To my delight, it's helped me in ways I never expected. Yes, my learning skills are sharper and broader, and growing. 

   But I'm also sleeping better, eating better and enjoying playful breaks from my work to exercise in the back yard.

   Most profoundly, my relationships with family, friends and colleagues are flourishing, thanks to a better understanding of myself and others.

   But there's always room for improvement and as much as things have gotten better, its feels like this journey is just beginning.

   What I'm trying to say is I'm a *big* fan. 

   If I could plant just one seed today, it would be *this* course.

   The crucial benefit I've gained from my Learning How to Learn /studies/, is the confidence that I /will/ continue to improve my learning skills, which will accelerate learning in every other aspect of my life, including learning to program.

   Perhaps you're already confident in your ability to learn, and why shouldn't you be!?!

   After all you've gotten this far along in life, right!?!

   Fortunately, the brain comes pre-built to learn.

   The challenge then is this: can we learn to work with the natural 'grain' of the brain, can we learn even more efficiently? And what would our world look like if we did this en masse? 

   My hope is that you will find at least one thing in this talk that will help you in your own learning journey, whatever your goals may be.

   Toward that end I will touch on many aspects of the subject of learning. Each aspect can serve as a unique personal starting point, or fork in the road, for your own curiosity driven research.

These are too many incidental details to take on for a newcomer and distract from the fundamental simplicity of what Namespaces are about. It does, however, help to know that such incidental complexity has a purpose in Clojure, which is to keep unaware developers from shooting their toes off. This mentor related perspective helped me accept Clojure's complexity around Namespaces with more of an open mind, taking the sting out of it.

* Old Pitches 
** How can we best support the needs of Clojure learners? Imagine a future where a person interested in learning Clojure was presented with a menu of learning paths, each leading to well defined learning outcomes and offering various 'on-ramps' for learners of varying skill levels, especially, for learners completely new to programming. Imagine a future where every learner feels welcome and supported through supportive human relationships, from participation in users groups, educational co-ops, and especially one-on-one apprentice/mentor pairings. How can we place the needs of the learner above all else and grow Clojure to the scale of its full potential? Much progress has already been made, but what more can we do, together, to reach this goal?
** A community-centered brainstorming session facilitated by vulnerably sharing my unconventional ideas about learning to program, and graciously inviting others to share their own. An experiment in group problem solving applied to the problem of learning 'Clojure'.
*** 'Clojure' as used here is a heavily overloaded term, referring the body of knowledge encompassing Clojure(ish) technologies: ClojureScript, Datomic, React, React Native, bash/zshell, deployment technologies such as immutable infrastructure etc. etc. etc.
** I intend to foster an interactive conversation with my audience about how we can create stronger and more creative mentor/apprentice relationships in our growing community. The jumping off point would be my personal learning path of going from Hero to Zero. (Hero to Zero is a greatly overloaded term that is meaningful to me, but likely mysterious to others, so it will be a conversational thread wherein I can relay my personal experience of learning programming and Clojure.)

I would enjoy revisiting the question anew, perhaps from a purely mathematical perspective.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
All joking aside, I'm deeply interested in this topic because learning to program, for me, has been a joy, but also a painful and lonely struggle.

I hope this talk can reach out and find aspiring learners at the outset of their learning journey. What can we do together to make learning Clojure a fantastic experience for everyone?

 My first story stems from the family category

 At the age of 3, I lived with my Mother in an apartment on the outskirts of Lincoln, Nebraska.

 In the evenings we sat on the balcony and watched the sunset over the golden wheat fields and countryside.

 One evening the sun set down right behind an old barn on the horizon.

 This was an exciting event for me.

 I was convinced that the sun was hiding just behind that barn, just over the hill where it had disappeared. 

 I remember, more than anything, just how badly I wanted to touch the sun!

 My mother, instead of telling me that that's just not the way the world works, drove me out to that barn the very next day at sunset.

 I could see for myself that we were at the barn, and still the sun was setting yet a long ways off.

 I learned something that day about how sunsets work, but I learned a far more important lesson about the power of demonstration and involving the pupil smack dab in the middle of a lesson, or a barn in the middle of nowhere in this case. Thanks Mom!

 #+BEGIN_NOTES

 My next story is about imagination.

 At the age 6 my best friend was Steve Peterson.

 Steve and I met at the apartments where I lived in Columbia, SC.

 He had a single Mom and so did I.

 The four of us were practically inseparable, and remain lifelong friends to this day.

 His mother Barbara Peterson was a kindergarten teacher. She was very good at her job.

 So good in fact, that she found herself being interviewed by Mr. Rogers on PBS. Mr Rogers!

 Playing at Steve's house was the best.

 Mrs. Peterson was masterful at sparking imagination.

 She encouraged us to use our imaginations often.

 She sewed super hero and other costumes for us to wear.

 The memory that came to mind instantly when I challenged myself to recall a life memory from the friends category is the day Steve and I went into a restaurant to order a hamburger.

 Steve and I were 5 and 6 years old, dressed up as college football players, each of us donning a uniform of the big local rivalry here in SC, the Carolina Gamecocks and Clemson Tigers.

 What makes the moment so memorable is that just before we got out of the car to go inside the local Wendy's, we turned to Mrs. Peterson and pleaded with her not tell anyone we weren't really college football players.

 "Oh no, of course I wouldn't give you away!" she said.

 It makes me smile to this day to think that we actually thought we'd be mistaken for college athletes.

 Mrs. Peterson taught me more than I could summarize in 10 hours, much less one, but that day I learned how to pretend which it turns out is a great skill to have.

*** Childlike Wonder & Awe

 #+BEGIN_NOTES 
 This next story is great example of inside out vs outside in learning, as it spans both.

 When I was around 8 years old I had a subscription to a kid's science magazine.

 I remember how amazed I was at learning new facts about the world.

 Animals were often my favorite subjects.

 Like how a blue whale's arteries are so large in diameter that a small child could swim through them. You know, cool stuff!

 I loved getting a new magazine at the beginning of the month, and would devour it within days, completely self-motivated to learn, a classic example of inside-out education.

 The other thing I loved to do was share these facts with other people, and watch their faces light up with amazement, shock or awe.

 Sometimes though, my timing was terrible.

 It was Thanksgiving day at Mrs. Peterson's and the table was set with Turkey and fixings.

 Everyone was hungry and we were ready to dig in, but first I needed to share an important fact with everyone!

 "Did you guys know that black pepper contains the highest percentage of insect parts, according the FDA?"

 I'll never forget the look on my Mom's face.

 She had some outside-in educating to do! And she did it.

 I'll never forget the joy of reading those magazines.

 I treasure the child-like sense of awe & wonder that I learned to cultivate by reading through those pages. And, of course, I always watch my manners at the dinner table! :O

 Thanks again, Mom!

*** Professor McKee 


 #+BEGIN_NOTES 
 In college, I had one professor that came to mind instantly when thinking about the career category.

 Professor Jim McKee.

 Professor McKee was a consummate professional.

 Being in his class felt more like participating in a job interview than it did a classroom.

 His sayings still echo in my head:

 "If you're not 5 minutes early, you're 5 minutes late!"

 "You never get a second chance to make a first impression!"

 And the arm length rule:

 "If you're within arms length of someone, stick out your hand and introduce yourself."

 Professor McKee told a story of his first big job break.

 He had an interview in an office building down town.

 He applied the arm length rule and introduced himself to the person riding the elevator with him.

 Turns out that person was his interviewer for the job, which of course he got.

 But the image of professor McKee I'll never get out of my head is the day he taught us how to draw cash flow diagrams in our engineering economics class.

 "The day of your investment you draw the arrow down because you have to part with your money so you're feeling low, low, low," he said as he drooped his torso, arms practically mopping the floor.

 "The day of your return on investment, you draw the arrow up, up, up!" he shouted as hopped on top his his desk and jumped up and down to the rhythm of his mantra.

 Professor McKee taught me just how much difference one teacher can in a person's life. Thanks Professor McKee.

*** Career in IT

  #+BEGIN_NOTES 

    After college, over 20 years ago, I wanted to pursue a career in IT.

    I decided to try a shortcut to breaking into the industry. I would get /*'certified'*/.

    There was just one problem.

    Despite 18 years of being a student, from pre-school to undergrad engineering degree, I had /*sparse*/ confidence in my own ability to efficiently learn.

    I signed up for a 6 month certification program, but delayed starting by 2 months, in order to study the fundamentals of adult education. 

    My brief studies about learning taught me to focus on demonstrating practical skill. 

    I purchased two computers from a trade show for $400, set them up with multiple boot configurations, and materialized every example in my text books into real world use cases.

    I also got a job at the certification office on the weekends, setting up workstations for the next week's courses, where I logged just over 2400 system installations.

    I was the first student to complete the local training program. I passed my tests with flying colors.

    I executed two successful job interviews in a row, allowing me to choose a place to begin my career.

    These actions were inspired by /investing/ 2 months of my life in learning about adult education.
   
    My shortcut driven efforts paid off in terms of personal finances, but were costly in another way.

    By succeeding at taking a shortcut, by taking the easy way, I reinforced a personal strategy that would cost precious time and money when I started to learn how to program, which I'll talk more about soon.

    The experience of learning about adult education was my first brush with learning about learning itself, but the profundity of it didn't sink in at the   time.

    It would be years later that I would look back and really glean wisdom from the experience.

**** This system should work pretty good unless we run into git workflow issues, in which case we can move out to email etc.
**** DONE items can be placed anywhere in the file so when you git pull you can just do a text search for "isaac" and bingo! :)

**** Thank you! I'll create a new subheading under Jay & Isaac called Isaac Projects where we can keep your big picture stuff.
**** DONE Great!

*** Wrangle Reveal.js CSS
**** DONE isaac10 Please study up on how to wrangle css for reveal.js so we can get page elements where we want them. (copied from above)
     CLOSED: [2017-02-02 Thu 09:40]
***** DONE Page element most concerned about is title at top left, space for video top right, paragraph/bullets left aligned half way down from top for first line.
      CLOSED: [2017-02-02 Thu 09:40]
Jay, I've got one stand-in solution for the top left h2 placement for now, using strictly CSS. And now that we've got custom JS involved too, we've got a lot of options for much more fine-grained and DOM-aware control.
**** DONE isaac20 research then tinker with getting webcam image as part of web page. (This might be tricky with reveal.js. Not sure how to best do it?)

***** I found this https://www.kirupa.com/html5/accessing_your_webcam_in_html5.htm
See email question about p2p video streaming.
***** In the mean time, you can just use a blll have a lot more controlank white rectangle to act as place holder.
***** On the title screen, the video would look better on the left. Not a high priority right now.
***** reach out and let me know how things are going, if they are unclear, or to ask any questions :)
*** TODO isaac300 research doing footnotes in org-mode. There's something called Bibtex too. (notice low priority)
*** Reveal notes
Setting the REVEAL_ROOT as a relative path above works for me, but is inconsistent with https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal. 
;; #+OPTIONS: reveal_width:1920 reveal_height:1080
;; note: function: org-toggle-inline-images   (toggles between showing images in buffer and showing text url of images file)
;; reveal_center:t 
note that I used two SPACES after the * to make the invisible heading for the non-title title slide.
#+mynotes: Use Big John / Little Joe for Headings, Quicksand for normal type and lobster for marking up pictures (or any combination of these.
* keystone aha! moment
After talking things over with Isaac yesterday, and building on his insightful feedback and original ideas, I rose this morning at 1:45 AM, and after 2 hours of naturally alternating between active & passive thought, I experienced the "keystone aha! moment" of this work.

The final valuation of learning is as deeply personal as is religious belief, as inextricable from living as is the air we breath from the wind that purifies it.

My gut tells me, that any quantifiable number yielding from a formal method of the valuation of learning, will be near meaningless when comparing the lives of individual people or groups.

This chief problem of apples to apples, oranges to oranges, derives from the identification problem. How do you and I agree on what is learning and what is not? I'm perfectly willing to try, as an exercise of discovery, if anyone ever wants to talk and think this through together in more detail for our mutual benefit, but my present striving and failing to prove otherwise has left me deeply skeptical after open-mindedly pursuing the truth of the problem to the limit my deadline, and personal mental energy, would allow.

The value of learning about learning, however, when viewed in the context of any person or group of people, has a more concrete value, which paradoxically approaches intrinsic value, as much perhaps as any other thing, but never quite touching the mark, owing to the infinite progression of infinitesimally smaller and smaller gaps which bookend the bell curve of opinion to the answer of the above identification problem, like t approaching zero in the calculus of the area of these two ever-diverging, bookend slopes. To pour this concrete, I claim, that as long as you and I can agree that learning exists, that it is vitally important to our mutual survival and potential to flourish, then pure logic dictates that an investment in time (not that we can, must or should agree on how much time) is a wise investment.

How so? Just as the brain may be the only matter in the physical universe capable of self-analysis, the act of learning about learning is also singularly unique. I claim it is the only identifiable activity which, by its intrinsic nature, which embodies the potential to impact each and every aspect of individual and group life, these our most precious gift, of infinite love or infinite time, take your pick, the product of a 'singular' event, leading to a second (itself shaping all of time and naming the clock's second hand), theorized to be an outward expanding burst of energy so active, so hot, that the first atom could not form before 400,000 years of cooling, itself a cosmic seed of stardust, stardust -- the seed of our bones, and sinew and brain matter.

Vita contemplativa fueling vita activa, a life of action, a life of learning, justified through reason.

And lest we forget it is the heart which manufactures the electricity which powers the gray matter, offering each person astounding computational power, for a price of only 10 to 100 millivolts of consumption.

The left and right sides of our brain are mirrors, or sources, of the cooperating reason and intuition which 'we', whatever we are, reconcile in a continuing saga of transcendent mystery.

So carry on, learning as you do, for, in the word's of Rich Hickey, "learning, it's what we do".

And never, ever let another tell you you're doing it wrong. You arrived here, grew into the person you are, as you are, as only you can be, learning along the way, trying, and trying and trying. Again, again, again. Learning, I boldly declare, should always be considered more art than science, lest a 'learning scientist' arrive upon your doorstep (ignorant of who you are, a learner through and through) to renounce your effort, and in kind, you're very being.

For when I nod, and smile and wish you my best, please know that this is the person I see, you at your very, very best. Let us reconcile the truth for ourselves, each to their own, but let us reconcile with each other today. Time waits not! For only will you and I, one with the other, supporting each other, as art and science, intuition and reason, love and law, solve our collective and existentially relevant problems. Today, I will hold as an ideal, humbly knowing that a great many times I will fall, and fall, and fall again, each time rising, with your help, to try my very best to give no offense, and take no offense as we reset, wipe the blackboard clean and break out a new box of chalk to 'science and see' the daylights out of this thing.
