 Thank you Ryan. I am super happy to be here at Clojure Remote 2017.  Welcome to each of you that are with us today to talk about /The Value of Learning/.

 Learning is important to me. I see it as the /*best way*/ to include the greatest number of people in the software dependent world in which we find ourselves.

  My goal for us today is to /*start*/ an ongoing conversation, within the Clojure community and beyond, about the /*art and science*/ of learning.

Before I dig in I just want to say that I've had more fun preparing for this talk, than on any project I've ever worked on. I hope this material can come alive in your own life and spark a new measure of joy, of awe and wonder, and of course, learning. Let's begin!

  In a group setting, I typically gravitate toward the role of facilitator. Let me put that hat on now to rev up our group-think engine.

  What if? What if we, this small, yet enthusiastic group of Clojure developers, could co-create an experience, over the next hour, that would serve the Clojure community for years to come? Attracting people to Clojure who've never even heard of it? 

  Imagine someone finding the /Value of Learning/ video on YouTube, the video you and I are already making together right this very minute. How will they find us? Probably a search about learning! So we already know something about this person we've never met. They're interested in learning. And so are you or wouldn't be here right now. So we all have something in common, we value learning!

  Turns out, that many people are interested in this topic. Millions and millions of people have taken the free online course, /Learning How to Learn/. How many of them want to write an app? Or learn to program. Probably most!

  As a community, we in Clojure, should think of this person as an honored guest. What is it that we have to offer them?

   We could start with the basics:

  "Welcome! Clojure is a general-purpose programming language, which means you can use it to do almost anything you can imagine."

  I might follow this up by saying, "Have you noticed lately how a lot of the technology we are so dependent on these days doesn't always behave the way we expect it to? Well, trust me it's not just you it's picking on. Software isn't anywhere near as reliable as it should be. In Clojure, we believe you increase reliability by building software in a fundamentally simpler way. This simplicity doesn't mean Clojure is easier to learn than other languages. It might not be. But it is a powerful language. And here's one big reason why:

   Clojure's a hosted language which means it adapts to its host environments, which includes any web browser, like the one on that phone in your pocket, and also Java and .NET environments. These three places are where the vast majority of software in the entire world gets built to run. This means Clojure can run alongside these languages, or instead of them, within the host environment.

  Clojure has a reputation of rock solid reliability. Which is why its flexibility and adaptability are that much more impressive. This may be its greatest unsung superpower. You don't need to understand the technical details of what I'm about to say to get a feel for Clojure's value...

  You see, languages come in two types, static and dynamic. Static languages are very safe because the system knows what kind of thing every /*thing*/ in the system is. Dynamic languages allow things to change more fluidly in the system, and as the name implies they allow a lot more cool stuff to happen while the program is running; dynamic stuff, like changing the innards of the running program itself.

 Now here's the good stuff: Rick Hickey, Clojure's author, came up with a 3rd way, heretofore undiscovered in the field of language design. We call it Spec which is short for specify and it allows to you to 'specify' which things in the system you want to quality check, and which you don't.

 What this means for you, as a software creator, is that you can manifest your ideas quickly, thanks to Clojure's dynamism, and add the safety you need later. Why should you work for the computer, when Clojure puts it to work for you?

 Spec is just one example, albeit quintessential, of the ground breaking innovation that's happening in Clojure. 

 Clojure is a community which fosters high impact innovation.

 Clojure's website captures the essence of Clojure perfectly: 'Clojure has a set of useful features that together form a simple, coherent, and powerful tool.'

 Simple, coherent, powerful. That's Clojure.

 Oh and by the way, the people in Clojure's community are eager to help you learn and succeed in your endeavors. When would you like to get together again to learn more?"

 Okay so we're back to the present moment, and that's what I would say to our guest. 

I propose we revisit this future scenario often, as a community, and ask ourselves, how can we serve the next person's needs even better than we did the last's?
 
 My answer to that question today, would be another question or two:
 
  What impact would it have on Clojure's growth if each of us were as fluent in the language of learning as we are in Clojure itself?

  And how attractive would Clojure be to our next guest if each of us were /*expert teachers*/?

 You, my audience, are the heart and soul of today's conversation. You're also its right brain.

 The left brain, that would be me, is highly verbal, orderly, and information rich. The right brain keeps an eye on the big picture, drawing relationships between disparate bits of information. It offers massive creative potential by counterbalancing the left-brains orderliness with a healthy dose of chaos.

 I have the script for this talk and you're holding the monkey wrench, needed make it something more, something different, something better than it could ever be without you.

 If we were an actual brain you wouldn't be able to see or hear me. There's a thingamijiggy in the brain, a conduit, which controls the communication that goes back and forth between the hemispheres. It let's information flow and it also filters information to allow one side to focus when its concentrating on its work. 
 
 Isaac is going to act as our conduit by listening to everything you say and handing me priority signals.

 What this means is that you have a significant role in the outcome of today's video: Am I going to fast? Too slow? Is the current slide boring you? Speak up and let your voice be heard! Isaacmajiggy will relay the group wisdom on, and filter out the noise.

 But before we get into that mode, let's meet Issac. Ryan, please invite Isaac to speak.

 Isaac is many things, including a web developer, and a new friend of mine. Isaac has been a tremendous help in preparing for this event, and he's new to Clojure, so he's great person to practice our hospitality skills on, please join me in welcoming Isaac. Isaac, hi, how are you?

... (isaac speaks)

Awesome, glad to hear it. Isaac, you're new to Clojure, you've heard my spiel. What's the first question that comes to mind for you regarding Clojure?

... (isaac asks question)

That's a great question, unfortunately my prepared script has no answer. Let's see what our right brain has to say about that. Thanks for dropping in and saying hello, Isaac. I'll see you later.

... (isaac says ciao)

Would someone more experienced than me please volunteer to drop in and answer Isaac's question?

... (Jay picks person or listens out for Isaacs pick)

Okay great, <name here>, is going to help me out. Ryan, please invite <name here> to speak for a minute or two.

... (Jay interacts with guest speaker)

Thank you for dropping in and helping us out <name here>. Isaac see I told you Clojure folks were friendly ready to help!

<name here> isn't the only one of you who can make a difference today. 

 [Ryan,please refocus my screen share.]

   Scattered throughout the talk, you'll notice a red pill appear on the lower right corner of the screen. Each pill contains a QR code. The QR codes lead to mini-polls, links to kick-start your research, or pre-filled tweets that will serve to network like minds around the subject of learning.

   Even if you're watching this on video, months or years from now, you can still participate by scanning the red pills with your smart phone.

   If you don't have a smart phone handy, or if you're watching this on your smart phone, you can relax and enjoy the show because we'll be converting the presentation into an interactive web site soon, as well as the YouTube video that will help as attract new guests.

   Isaac has been a /*tremendous*/ help with the development and content you'll see in the next 45 minutes. And now that we are playing on the Matrix theme, we can just call him Morpheus. And Ryan you can be Tank, our reliable operator!

   All of our work is available at the-value-of-learning github repository.

 #+BEGIN_NOTES 
  Learning and teaching are skills. They too can be learned, practiced, and mastered, like any other skill. Learning about learning is a new way of thinking for me. And it's also really good news. You see, even after 19 years of education, from pre-school to a degree in engineering, I had little confidence in my ability to learn technical knowledge and skills, like programming. This life experience is the source of my firm conviction that there is a subtle, yet profoundly important difference between learning, and learning how to learn. 

  Today, I'm learning more effectively than ever before, but more importantly I'm preserving my emotional energy for enjoying life more, because now I'm worrying less about my next learning challenge.

  After my own experience, I now believe that anyone can dramatically improve their ability to learn any subject, relative to their current ability. You might think you're just not naturally gifted  at drawing, or writing, or math, or you're not athletic, or you can't sing or hum a tune. That's the way it is, and that's that.

  Simply put, brain science says otherwise. We'll invest the next hour of our time to explore the nuance of this claim. 

  Being a part of the Clojure community has really inspired me to up my learning game. Rich Hickey's talk /Hammock Driven Development/, which is laden with learning wisdom, led me to the /Learning How to Learn/ online course, which we'll talk about in the third and final part of the talk.

  We'll get back to Clojure later but now I want to /draw you in/ to this whole learning thing. Check this out:

 5 days. These people, people not unlike you or me, learned the technical fundamentals of drawing in only 5 days. 
 
 Personally, I'm astonished by these drawings.
 
 This rapid learning reminds of a scene in The Matrix, where Neo and Trinity see a helicopter.

 He asks her "Can you fly that thing?"

 With stoic confidence she replies, "Not yet". 

 (NEXT FRAG) 

 Moments later she is skillfully flying the aircraft.

 How does Betty Edwards facilitate such efficient progress for her students?
 
 And how is her approach relevant to learning other highly technical skills, such as programming?
 
 We'll dig into these questions, but first let me clarify my credentials.

   What are my qualifications for giving this talk?

   I'm speaking to you today as a layperson.

   And if I've learned anything about this subject, its that learning is full of paradox.

   It often results from a process of reconciliation between competing ideas or ways of thinking.

   Almost any statement of truth I might profess about learning, can probably be argued the other way as well.
 
   This wasn't readily apparent to me when I began this project, but its crystal clear to me now.

   And I'm more humble for the effort.

   Fortunately, I have a long and

   (NEXT FRAG) documented history of putting my foot in my mouth.

   Yes, that's me at 10 months.  

   This talk aims to kick start an ongoing conversation about our individual and shared experiences of learning.

   While researching this talk, many people have shared with me, their own learning experiences, with insight and candor.

   My hope is that by candidly sharing my learning experiences, publicly, other people might identify with both my learning struggles and triumphs, and that together we might be able find a better way of tackling some of our common problems around learning and teaching.

So how does Betty Edwards do it?

(NEXT FRAG 02-montage)

How does she accelerate the learning process of her drawing students so dramatically?

Betty Edwards teaches people 5 fundamental /seeing/ skills:

(NEXT FRAG)

How to *perceive* edges, spaces, relationship, lights & shadows and the gestalt (or whole).

Just as Rich Hickey, after years of studious practice, discovered identity, values & time as the core fundamentals of software, Betty identified the basic building blocks within the skill of drawing.

After much practice and study, she had an aha! moment. These 5 subskills were it.

What if drawing could be taught and learned quickly, not over the course years?

Her method was validated by the rapid progress of her students.

Edward's techniques revolve around understanding each brain hemisphere's role in the creative process, and employing the best suited hemisphere for the task at hand.

#+BEGIN_NOTES

Her book, /Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain/, covers this subject with the detail it deserves, but I'll do my best to summarize.

Seeing is the domain of the right brain hemisphere.

This presents a unique challenge because, as the evidence Edward's compiles in her book suggests, the right brain is constantly being drowned out by left-brain activity, stimulated by our modern, technical, language-driven society.

This not only stymies our ability to draw, it dulls our general problem solving skills too.

Of course, the brain never really shuts half of itself completely off, but one half can be more active than the other.

She's designed several unique exercises, such as drawing from a picture which is upside-down to trigger right brain activity.

#+BEGIN_NOTES

Looking at an upside-down picture disrupts the left brain's habit of naming what is seen, so it loses interest which allows the right brain to step in and do what it's good at -- perceiving visually.

The left-brain methodically structures the product step by step, while the right-brain keeps an eye on the big picture.

What does her work imply for programmers? Are we supposed to turn our code upside and stare at it?

According to Edward's, perceptual skills translate to general problem solving skills.

Perceiving edges and relationships between the conceptual components of any problem are vital skills toward solving that problem. As are seeing the whole and subtleties, i.e. the lights and shadows.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
In her book, /Drawing on the Artist Within/, Betty Edward's deeply explores the the five stages of creativity which initiate from a question held in mind and crescendo in the /Illumination/ phase, more widely known as the aha! moment :

The illumination phase is a joint celebration between the left and right hemisphere's of the brain.

Some people report rapid heart rates and a profound sense of "things coming together".

As Betty Edward's states, "It is perhaps a moment when the whole human brain is suffused with joy."

Einstein described one of his aha moments about gravity as "the happiest moment in my life". 

We can summarize the work of Betty Edward's by saying that her students progress so rapidly because they are learning the essential fundamental skills of seeing.

** Learning, the invisible value
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted. -- Bertrand Russell
  #+END_QUOTE

  #+BEGIN_NOTES

 Before we assess the central question of this talk, let me /try/ to clarify the question.

 /Education/ is often touted as a panacea to to the world's problems.

 Over time, I've observed that different people mean different things when saying these exact same words.

 Learning is obviously important, but when we talk about learning, what do we mean?

 School? College? Career? Breathing?

 Okay, fortunately some things come to us quite naturally.

 At first glance, the question "What is the value of learning?" appears to be quite basic. 

 It was Bertrand Russell who said, "In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted."

 I believe that we have a lot to gain, and nothing to lose, by applying Russell's wisdom to the subject of learning.

 Invisible values risk becoming neglected values.

 If we persist in repeating the mantra "education is the answer", without periodically reflecting on it's meaning, the words begin to ring hollow and lose their power.

 My hope is that by thoughtfully assessing the value of learning for ourselves, we can discover something new, something overlooked, and gain insight into the invisible value of learning.

  #+END_NOTES

** Brain, the invisible organ
 #+BEGIN_NOTES 

 While learning may be the invisible value, the brain is the invisible organ. At least that's my explanation of why, in my youth, I was *not* very interested in the brain, or how I could use it to improve my life.

 For all its potential power, surely there /must be/ some explanation why I wasn't in awe of the brain.

 A couple of reasons have come to mind:

 In my case, the brain science of the day said that once a human embryo was fully developed the brain had a fixed number of brain cells, and no new cells would ever be produced.

 The message behind the message, to my ear, was "You can't get any smarter. You're either smart or you're not."

 And maybe there's another reason why the brain goes unappreciated to kids -- the brain has to compete with a heartbeat.

 As a very young child, the heartbeat was a constant reminder, "I have a heart!"

 It just so happens that each of us, by better understanding how our brains function, can work 'with the grain' of the brain to improve both our intuition, which  is associated with our 'gut instinct', and our emotional intelligence, which has long been the associated with the heart. 

 Maybe the brain just needs better PR.

/Learning/ means *the activity or process of gaining knowledge or skill by studying, practicing, being taught, or experiencing something*.

According to the definition, gaining knowledge or skill is the goal of learning.

Knowledge or skill. I like how simple that sounds, but is it too simple. Can we learn new ways of being or behaving. For example, can I raise my 'average mood' or lower my anxiety?  These might considered skills too, I suppose.

Also according to the definition, there are a handful of ways to gain knowledge or skill: study, practice, observation, and experience.

#+BEGIN_NOTES 

The history of the word /learn/ goes back to the latin word /lira/ which means *furrow* or *track*.

The word furrow really sticks out to me. A furrow is *a long trench*. But not just any trench! *a long narrow trench in the ground made by a plow, especially for planting seeds*. 

The latin meaning is my new, favorite way to think about learning -- planting a long trail of seeds, seeds of knowledge and skill, which will grow and flourish in time! How cool is that!?!

... And yes, of course, Isaac certainly has some opinioned ideas about on the matter...

But for now, let's... ignore him ;-). We've got some ground to cover.

(NEXT FRAG canyon)

The 1926 paper /The Meaning of Adult Education/, by Eduard C. Lindeman, reignited the subject of learning and established a scientific, research oriented approach to understanding how adults learn.  

It's helpful to remember that the science of learning is a young science.

** Two faces of education
- Outside In
- Inside Out

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
The meaning of the word education is multifaceted, stemming from the two branches of its latin roots.

These two faces of education can be generally described as /Outside In/ & /Inside Out/. 

(NEXT SLIDE DOWN)

.

.

.
#+END_NOTES


*** Outside In
educare: to train or mold

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
The latin /educare/ means: to train or mold.

Proponents of the "outside in" perspective of education seek to impart knowledge and form students by shaping them according to templates of idealized virtues and skill.

As in, "The University educates its students by giving them knowledge."

(NEXT SLIDE DOWN)

.

.

.
#+END_NOTES

*** Inside Out
educere: to lead out

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
The latin /educere/ means: *to lead out*.

Advocates of the "inside out" perspective of education seek to prepare the student for the unpredictable challenges of the future by focusing the pupil's attention on the process of acquiring new skills and knowledge.

As in, "The students education is evident in their lifelong curiosity about the world in which they live."

Both faces of education likely have their ideal time and place.

It seems we are in the early stages of discovering an ideal balance between the two, especially regarding our new information driven world.

# Isaac says:
# 1. Citing falling standardize test scores in critique of outside-in learning is self-contradictory.
# 2. Japan is not exactly known to be a student's paradise. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/uloop/japans-education-disaster_b_8691650.html
# 3. Germany also places a great emphasisis on individual standardized test performance, and initiates 'tracking' very early (from 8th grade?) based on scores. France similarly.
# 4. Perhaps Finland is a more effective example? http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/why-are-finlands-schools-successful-49859555/
# 5. You may be pointing to a very deep rift. Some extreme collegiate examples: a.) Reed College vs. b.) MIT. Or... a Waldof+/Montessori methods vs. some of the magnet+charter schools in New York (think uniforms, discipline, per-second schedules). There are examples of both outperforming peers, despite widely varying methods. There are two challenges being adressed: one is cultivating independent, creative, resourceful and innovative thinking, the other developing technical, formal, and canonical precision and regularity. In any case, these couple of sentences below bely challenges and reminiscences worth book, even lifetimes of them. I would be careful about hard-and-fast conclusions. Forgive me if I'm being too forward.

** Axiology

The philosophical study of value.
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Pursuing this question led me to the field of axiology, which is the philosophical study of value.

This study dates back to the time of ancient Greece, when Plato first wrote about the distinction between intrinsic value and instrumental value.

*** Intrinsic vs Instrumental
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
According to axiology, learning has intrinsic value if it is valuable in and of itself.

Learning has instrumental value if it serves as a means toward achieving something else.

As in, "Learning to speak German helped me make new friends in Berlin."

*** Limitations of Axiology
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Axiology provides a helpful framework for /thinking and talking/ about the value of something, because values are more nebulous than facts.

If values were facts, we could seek an answer to our question scientifically. Is there a way to convert values into facts?

What other fields might help us?

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Value theory is a modern approach to understanding value. It stems from axiology, but seeks to determine value through scientific observation.

What do people value and why? Psychology, sociology and economics each provide a unique lens through which to study value.

For example, a sociologist might be interested in how different groups of people value learning similarly or differently.

A psychologist might seek to measure the value of learning by categorizing learning subjects according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

(NEXT FRAG)

An economist might choose to measure the value of learning in terms of goods and services related to learning which are sold in the marketplace.

** Flip the question

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
At this point in my research, I thought of a potential shortcut to answering the question. What if we could prove that learning was harmful?

We're in the age of information. Knowledge streams across the internet at up to two thirds the speed of light. Isn't it possible that malicious actors could use this information destructively?

I'm learning to program, and I want to help others learn too. Are these actions helping society or are they hurting?

This is an important question! If they're hurting, I should cease and desist now.

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
So, /*is*/ learning harmful?

Upon asking this question, I struck gold in finding the article (NEXT FRAG) /Is knowledge "good" or "neutral"?/

The author, Piotr Wozniak, raises some of the same questions I was asking myself about malicious actors in the world.

Wozniak claims that Knowledge is good.

The article supports this claim by elaborating in great detail over a simple five-step chain of reasoning.

Wozniak argues that humans benefit through cooperation and lose out on conflict, and claims this truth can be demonstrated mathematically with the tools of game theory.

We don't have time to walk through his reasoning in detail, but I highly recommend this article as an exercise in critical thinking.

After reading the article, I noticed that I felt a bit more lighthearted in my work.

I feel like its helped relieve my cognitive dissonance about facilitating technological advances for our society.

Although I'm still quite curious about how this line of reasoning will hold up against artificial intelligence.

** Systems of value
- hedonism
- religion
- scientific axiology

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Wozniak's article also serves as a gentle introduction to axiology and value theory.

There are three major systems of value: hedonism, religion and scientific axiology.

Hedonism values pleasure and devalues pain. It's been around since multi-celled organisms developed nervous systems.

Religion uses faith and reason to ascribe value.

And Scientific axiology strives to measure value using only the scientific method. 

All other systems of value can be categorized within or among these three.

Most people apply a conglomeration of these three value systems to evaluate their goals.

** Finding Clojure 

 #+BEGIN_NOTES 
    My path to finding Clojure has been long and sometimes emotionally painful.

    Instead of productive struggle, much of the path has felt like needless struggle.

    I'd like to help other newcomers find their way before they suffer the bumps and bruises I've experienced. 

    The main reason I've chosen Clojure is that I want to learn to think about the fundamentals of programming in the same way that Rich Hickey does - identities, values, time, these are his fundamental building blocks.

    Masters of a craft, discover, not only its essence, but how to practice it with great efficiency.

    While its true that professionals perform difficult tasks, they most certainly aren't doing them the hard way.

    Who are the professionals? What results are they achieving? And how are they achieving those results.

    I will save time, not by finding the easy way, but by mastering the fundamentals that bring very difficult problems within the reach of studious practitioners.

     Rich Hickey, in his talk /Simple Made Easy/ acknowledges that Clojure has a higher learning curve than other languages. Fortunately, learning and teaching already define the essence of this community, from the mind-expanding talks, to the daily exchanges of thinking through a problem with a peer, in person or online, its really one big, ongoing conversation. 

     To a person, everyone in this community that I've asked for help has generously shared their knowledge to help me learn. And to a person, everyone I've met is pretty keen on Clojure. 
    
It is incumbent upon us, the community, to compensate for Clojure's higher learning curve, and we can do this by collectively mastering the art and science of learning and teaching.

     If there's a group of people in the world who can solve this problem, it's you. If you're up for the challenge, please listen to the talk with the problem of Clojure's learning curve in the back of your mind. Are we missing something obvious?

* Closing


#+BEGIN_NOTES 
Software itself, has parallel to learning, it touches on nearly all fields of human endeavor as we move into our shared future. We must get it right.

Learning is lever long enough to move the world and include everyone in our shared future, a future which is beckoning us to flourish through cooperation, the sharing of knowledge and the pursuit of wisdom.

The ability to try is the one thing each living creature is given, and guaranteed to possess, for the duration of our stay.

Therefore, let us try.

We might feel like we're  running at a the windmill at times, but we must keep charging, we must never give up.

So carry on, learning as you do, for, in the word's of Rich Hickey, "learning, it's what we do".

And never, ever let another tell you you're doing it wrong. You arrived here, grew into the person you are, as you are, as only you can be, learning along the way, trying, and trying and trying. Again, again, again.

 Learning, I boldly declare, should always be considered more art than science, lest a 'learning scientist' arrive upon your doorstep (ignorant of who you really are, a learner through and through, and so much more) only to renounce your effort, and in kind, you're very being.

For when I nod, and smile and wish you my best, please know that this is the person I see, you at your very, very best. Let us reconcile the truth for ourselves, each to their own, but let us reconcile with each other today. Time waits not! For only will you and I, one with the other, supporting each other, as do art and science, intuition and reason, love and law, solve our collective and existentially relevant problems. Today, I will hold as an ideal, humbly knowing that a great many times I will fall, and fall, and fall again, each time rising, with your help, to try my very best to give no offense, and take no offense as we reset, wipe the blackboard clean and break out a new box of chalk to 'science and see' the living  daylights out of this thing, as we joyfully declare the words of Mahatma Gandhi himself,

"Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever."

Thank you and fare well.
