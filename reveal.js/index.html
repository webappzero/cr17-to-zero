<ul>
<li><a href="#/slide-orgef60bae">e.g. (Source: Russ Olsen) Russ helped me see that Namespaces were simply mappings of names to values but my learning of the subject was distracted by my instinct to tackle the complex aspects of Namespaces: symbols refer to vars, which refer to mutable storage locations, which contain values. These are too many incidental details to take on for a newcomer and distract from the fundamental simplicity of what Namespaces are about. It does, however, help to know that such incidental complexity has a purpose in Clojure, which is to keep unaware developers from shooting their toes off. This mentor related perspective helped me accept Clojure's complexity around Namespaces with more of an open mind, taking the sting out of it.</a></li>

Imagine a future where a person interested in learning Clojure was presented with a menu of learning paths, each leading to well defined learning outcomes and offering various 'on-ramps' for learners of varying skill levels, especially, for learners completely new to programming. Imagine a future where every learner feels welcome and supported through supportive human relationships, from participation in users groups, educational co-ops, and especially one-on-one apprentice/mentor pairings. How can we place the needs of the learner above all else and grow Clojure to the scale of its full potential? Much progress has already been made, but what more can we do, together, to reach this goal?</a></li>

<h3 id="org5fe13b0">What is this talk about?</h3>
<p>
This talk focuses a spotlight on the science of learning. Just how much do we value learning itself as a subject worthy of careful study? And what are we prepared to do about it?
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgb25123a">
<h3 id="orgb25123a">What aren't the goals of this talk?</h3>
<p>
-Not a comprehensive tutorial on the science of learning!
-Not a comprehensive introduction to Clojure.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org5ff2247">
<h3 id="org5ff2247">Who is the target audience?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Existing Clojure programmers</li>
<li>Aspiring programmers</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Both of these groups include scientists, entrepreneurs, people that want to help solve the world's problems. It's hard to think of an ambitious project in any of these areas whose success won't be directly dependent on its use of software technology.
</p>

<p>
I myself want to start a software company. My decade long experience as an IT professional taught me that I will either run my software company, or it will run me. That's why I've chosen Clojure and why I'm so enthusiastic about sharing it with programming newcomers.
</p>

</aside>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgc4e509a">
<h3 id="orgc4e509a">What are the goals of this talk?</h3>
<ul>
<li>For programmers, presumably Clojure programmers: to pique your interest in the science of learning by examining its history, tenets and potential benefits.</li>
<li>For aspiring programmers: To attract and welcome you to the Clojure community. To make sure that, even if you consider yourself a mere mortal, average like me, that you have the confidence to get started today, knowing that you can achieve your learning goals, and that you will have an amazing and supportive community in Clojure, to guide you along the way.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Learning is like breathing &#x2013; we're always doing it. My thoughts on learning are being articulated through a lifetime of inherited and accumulated personal biases, many, if not most of which, I am probably unaware. That's why I need your help to unlock the potential discoveries of this fledgling research.

<section id="slide-orgc077712">
<h4 id="orgc077712">Seriously though&#x2026;</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
All joking aside, I'm deeply interested in this topic because learning to program, for me, has been a joy, but also a painful and lonely struggle. My experience and instincts tell that by the time most people discover Clojure, they've suffered needlessly for too long. I hope this talk can reach out and find aspiring learners at the outset of their learning journey. What can we do together to make learning Clojure a fantastic experience for everyone?

<h4 id="orgef60bae">e.g. (Source: Russ Olsen) Russ helped me see that Namespaces were simply mappings of names to values but my learning of the subject was distracted by my instinct to tackle the complex aspects of Namespaces: symbols refer to vars, which refer to mutable storage locations, which contain values. These are too many incidental details to take on for a newcomer and distract from the fundamental simplicity of what Namespaces are about. It does, however, help to know that such incidental complexity has a purpose in Clojure, which is to keep unaware developers from shooting their toes off. This mentor related perspective helped me accept Clojure's complexity around Namespaces with more of an open mind, taking the sting out of it.</h4>

<h3 id="orge8e6d2c">How can we best support the needs of Clojure learners? Imagine a future where a person interested in learning Clojure was presented with a menu of learning paths, each leading to well defined learning outcomes and offering various 'on-ramps' for learners of varying skill levels, especially, for learners completely new to programming. Imagine a future where every learner feels welcome and supported through supportive human relationships, from participation in users groups, educational co-ops, and especially one-on-one apprentice/mentor pairings. How can we place the needs of the learner above all else and grow Clojure to the scale of its full potential? Much progress has already been made, but what more can we do, together, to reach this goal?</h3>
