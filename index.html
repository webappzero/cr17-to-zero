<p>
I'm not an expert in programming, nor in the science of learning. 
</p>

<p>
This talk is a slice of my life experiences around learning.
</p>

<p>
After college, over 20 years ago, I wanted to pursue a career in IT.
</p>

<p>
I decided to try a shortcut to breaking into the industry. I would get <i><b>'certified'</b></i>.
</p>

<p>
There was just one problem.
</p>

<p>
Despite 18 years of being a student, from pre-school to undergrad engineering degree, I had <i><b>sparse</b></i> confidence in my own ability to efficiently learn.
</p>

<p>
I signed up for a 6 month certification program, but delayed starting by 2 months, in order to study the <i>science of learning</i>. 
</p>

<p>
I was the first student to complete the local training program. I passed my tests with flying colors.
</p>

<p>
I landed two job offers in my first two interviews, and my career in IT was established.
</p>

<p>
My brief studies about learning taught me to focus on understanding vocabulary and demonstrating practical skill. 
</p>

<p>
I purchased two computers from a trade show for $400, set them up with multiple boot configurations, and materialized every example in my text books into real world use cases.
</p>

<p>
I also got a job at the certification office on the weekends, setting up workstations for the next week's courses, where I logged just over 2400 system installations.
</p>

<p>
I executed two successful job interviews in a row, allowing me to choose a place to begin my career.
</p>

<p>
These actions were <i>all</i> inspired by <i>investing</i> 2 months of my life in learn about learning.
</p>

<p>
My shortcut driven efforts paid off in terms of personal finances, but were costly in other ways, which I'll explain soon.

<h3 id="org6f9766d">How I got to Clojure</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
My path to finding Clojure has been long and sometimes painful.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to help other newcomers find it before they suffer the bumps and bruises I've experienced. 
</p>

<p>
I started programming at age 10.  By age 12, I was more interested in riding my bike than in staying inside the house.
</p>

<p>
A few years ago, I started dabbling in programming again, in my spare time.
</p>

<p>
I grew an interest in web applications, and had multiple ideas for potential businesses.
</p>

<p>
I looked for 'easy' ways to make web apps.
</p>

<p>
Even though I the lessons I learned 20 years before about technical study were generally helpful, I picked up a way of thinking that needed to be unlearned.
</p>

<p>
And given my sometimes stubborn nature, I had to learn the following lesson twice: Stop trying to do it the easy way!
</p>

<p>
Twice, I tried to learn an 'easy' web framework, when I should have been focused on the fundamentals of programming.
</p>

<p>
By the time I heard Rich Hickey's talk, Simple Made Easy, I was totally receptive to his message.
</p>

<p>
In my own words, what I learned from him is that many approaches appear easy at first glance. But most <i>easy</i> systems are actually highly complicated systems masquerading behind a thin veil of superficial usability.
</p>

<p>
These systems will consume more time and resources the further a team gets into a greenfield project, before eventually grinding the progress of customization requests to a near halt.
</p>

<p>
My main goal is to work with code and technology which facilitates understanding, allowing the team to focus on the domain problem at hand.
</p>

<p>
I want to avoid being forced by my technology stack into saying, "No! Sorry, we can't do that, because the system won't allow it!" Not good.
</p>

<p>
The main reason I've chosen Clojure is that I want to learn to think about the fundamentals of programming in the same way that Rich Hickey does - identities, values, time, these are his fundamental building blocks.
</p>

<p>
Masters of a craft, discover, not only its essence, but how to practice it with great efficiency.
</p>

<p>
Who are the professionals? What results are they achieving? And how are they achieving those results.
</p>

<p>
I will save time, not by finding the easy way, but by mastering the fundamentals that bring very difficult problems within the reach of mortals, like me. Thank you Rich Hickey! 
</p>

<section id="slide-org1bc67ec">
<h3 id="org1bc67ec">New goal</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
I have an ambitious goal. I want to be skilled in all aspects of creating a web app, from the front end to the back, using Clojure technologies, including ClojureScript, Datomic, React Native, Arachne and so on. 
</p>

<p>
But first, the fundamentals! Identity, values, time.
</p>

<p>
Forests emerge from a single tree, and a tree from a single seed.
</p>

<p>
That's the essence of my message today &#x2013; planting seeds.
</p>

<p>
Someone planted a seed in my mind over a year ago about taking the 4 hour online course, <i>Learning How to Learn</i> by Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski.
</p>

<p>
After slowly going through the course over many months, branching my studies off of the main curriculum by following the compass of my own innate curiosity, I can say unequivocally taking this course is the best thing I have ever done for myself!
</p>

<p>
It's helped me in ways I never expected. Yes, my learning skills are sharper and broader, and growing. But I'm also sleeping better, eating better and enjoying frequent breaks from my work to playfully exercise in the back yard. Most profoundly, I'm getting along better with the people I work and live with, thanks to better communication skills and a clearer understanding myself and others. There's always room for improvement and as much as things have gotten better, I feel like this journey is just beginning.
</p>

<p>
What I'm trying to say is I'm a <b>big</b> fan. 
</p>

<p>
If I could plant just one seed today, it would be <b>this</b> course.
</p>

<p>
The crucial benefit I've gained from my Learning How to Learn <i>studies</i>, is the absolute conviction that I <i>will</i> succeed if I put in the work.
</p>

<p>
I imagine this sounds to you like overstated positive thinking, but it's not, it's brain science, and I'll back up this claim in a bit, because I want you to believe this about yourself too. Doing so significantly increases your odds of learning success.
</p>

<p>
My hope is that you will find at least one thing in this talk that will help you in your own learning journey, whatever your goals may be.
</p>

<p>
Toward that end I will touch on many aspects of the subject of learning. Each aspect can serve as a unique personal starting point, or fork in the road, for your own curiosity driven research.
</p>

<p>
Before we get started there's one more thing you need to know about this talk. 
</p>

<p>
It's not just a talk.
</p>

<p>
It began its life open to community as an open source github repository, and has evolved into an open-data project, driven by your anonymous, interactive input.
</p>

<p>
You'll notice many red pills throughout the talk on the lower right corner of the screen. These are mini-polls, links to kick-start your research or pre-filled tweets that will serve to network like minds around the subject of learning. Even if you're watching this on video, months or years from now, you can still participate by scanning the qr codes with your phone.
</p>

<p>
This is your red pill, blue pill moment. Scan the red pill now if, like me, you were astonished by the Betty Edward's drawings and are curious to learn more. No pressure though, think of this talk as a garden and pick the fruit that appeals to your senses.
</p>

<p>
We're going to explore many aspects of learning through the framework of learning's <i><b>worth</b></i>.
</p>

<p>
Let's get started!

In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted. &#x2013; Bertrand Russell
</p>
</blockquote>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Before I jump in and try to answer the central question of this talk, I feel the need to justify the basic nature of the question, because <i>learning</i> appears to be among the most universally accepted of human values. At first glance the answer to the question, "Do I value learning?" appears to be so obvious that the question seems silly or trite, maybe even a complete waste of time.
</p>

<p>
Bertrand Russell said, "In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted."
</p>

<p>
I believe that we have a lot to gain and nothing to lose by putting Bertrand Russell's wisdom to work on the subject of learning.
</p>

<p>
Invisible values risk being neglected values. My hope is that by thoughtfully assessing the value of learning for ourselves, we can mitigate this risk and reach our individual and collective learning potential.
</p>

<p>
At the very least, attempting to answer this question is in accord with the age old wisdom, "know thyself."  (time 3:32)

<section id="slide-orgdce98b2">
<h3 id="orgdce98b2">Brain, the invisible organ</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
While learning may be the invisible value, the brain is the invisible organ. At least that's the excuse I use to explain why, in my youth, I was <b>not</b> very interested in the brain, or how I could use it to improve my life.
</p>

<p>
I mean, for all its potential power, surely there must be some explanation why the brain wasn't appreciated more deeply in my youth.
</p>

<p>
A couple of reasons have come to mind:
</p>

<p>
In my case, the brain science of the day led my teachers to inform me that I was given a fixed number of brain cells, and no new cells would ever be produced. What I heard was "You can't any smarter. You've either got it or you don't."
</p>

<p>
And here's another simple observation &#x2013; the brain <i>cannot</i> compete with a heartbeat. As a very young child, getting to know my own body, the heartbeat was a constant reminder, "I have a heart!"
</p>

<p>
Maybe the brain just needs better PR. This talk hopes to remedy that. No let's proceed with body of the talk by starting with the question.  (time 4:38)

<p>
<i>Learning</i> means <b>the activity or process of gaining knowledge or skill by studying, practicing, being taught, or experiencing something</b>.
</p>

<p>
The history of the word <i>learn</i> goes back through the Middle English word <i>lernen</i>, which shares the meaning <b>to learn</b> with the Old English word <i>leornian</i>, and further back to the Old English word <i>last</i> which means <b>foot print</b>, and finally, all the way back to the latin word <i>lira</i> which means <b>furrow</b> or <b>track</b>.
</p>

<p>
The meaning <b>track</b> ties in neatly with the <b>foot print</b> from the Old English <i>last</i>. 
</p>

<p>
But the word furrow really stuck out to me. Firstly because I didn't know what it meant in this context, which is <b>a long trench</b>. But not just any trench! <b>a long narrow trench in the ground made by a plow, especially for planting seeds</b>. 
</p>

<p>
The latin meaning has become my favorite way to think about learning &#x2013; planting a trail of seeds, seeds of knowledge and skill, which will grow and flourish in time! How cool is that!?!

<h4 id="org39885e9">e.g. (Source: Russ Olsen) Russ helped me see that Namespaces were simply mappings of names to values but my learning of the subject was distracted by my instinct to tackle the complex aspects of Namespaces: symbols refer to vars, which refer to mutable storage locations, which contain values. These are too many incidental details to take on for a newcomer and distract from the fundamental simplicity of what Namespaces are about. It does, however, help to know that such incidental complexity has a purpose in Clojure, which is to keep unaware developers from shooting their toes off. This mentor related perspective helped me accept Clojure's complexity around Namespaces with more of an open mind, taking the sting out of it.</h4>

Imagine a future where every learner feels welcome and supported through supportive human relationships, from participation in users groups, educational co-ops, and especially one-on-one apprentice/mentor pairings.

Much of the talk is about the human brain, and almost anything I say about the brain that fits into an hour long talk will be grossly over-simplified.

Learning is like breathing &#x2013; we're always doing it. My thoughts on learning are being articulated through a lifetime of inherited and accumulated personal biases, many, if not most of which, I am probably unaware. That's why I need your help to unlock the potential discoveries of this fledgling research.

All joking aside, I'm deeply interested in this topic because learning to program, for me, has been a joy, but also a painful and lonely struggle. My experience and instincts tell that by the time most people discover Clojure, they've suffered needlessly for too long. I hope this talk can reach out and find aspiring learners at the outset of their learning journey. What can we do together to make learning Clojure a fantastic experience for everyone?

Truncating lines and visual breaks. Nice. If you want, you can establish those settings as defaults in your config file. Can use `SPC-?` (Helm describes bindings) to figure out the proper names.

Jay, I've got one stand-in solution for the top left h2 placement for now, using strictly CSS. And now that we've got custom JS involved too, we've got a lot of options for much more fine-grained and DOM-aware control.
